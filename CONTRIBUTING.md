# Contributing to Dereck's Notes

Thank you for considering contributing. Below is what you need to get set up locally and the conventions this repo uses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (JavaScript runtime)
- Git

### Setup

1. **Fork** the repo and clone your fork.
2. **Install dependencies** (workspaces handle `client`, `server`, `shared` in one go):
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
   This also wires the native git hooks under `.githooks/` via the `prepare` script. If your commits later land without auto-formatting, re-run `bun install`.
3. **Start development**:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```
   Runs the client on `:3000` and the server on `:3001` concurrently.

### Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bun run dev` | Client + server in development mode |
| `bun run build` | Production-style build of the client |
| `bun run start` | Run the built client + server |
| `bun run format` | Prettier across the whole repo |
| `bun run lint` | ESLint on the client |
| `bun run typecheck` | TypeScript `--noEmit` on the client |
| `bun run test` | `bun test` |
| `bun run db:generate` | Generate a Drizzle migration from schema changes |
| `bun run db:migrate` | Apply pending migrations |
| `bun run db:seed` | Seed the database with default data |
| `bun run db:reset` | Reset the database (development only) |
| `bun run db:studio` | Open Drizzle Studio (DB browser) |

## Code Style

- **TypeScript**: strict mode, ESNext modules.
- **Formatting**: 2-space indent, 80-char width, single quotes, no trailing comma (defined in root `package.json` under `"prettier"`).
- **React**: functional components, explicit prop types.
- **Imports**: use `@/*` path aliases in client code.

The `pre-commit` hook runs `bun run format` on every commit so formatting is automatic — you shouldn't need to run it by hand.

## Pull Requests

1. **Branch**: pick a descriptive name.
2. **Commit messages**: short, clear subjects. For longer rationale, put it in the PR description.
3. **Push** to your fork and open a PR; the [pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md) walks you through the checklist.

## Issue Creation

- Use a descriptive title.
- Provide reproduction steps and screenshots where useful.
- Add relevant labels.
