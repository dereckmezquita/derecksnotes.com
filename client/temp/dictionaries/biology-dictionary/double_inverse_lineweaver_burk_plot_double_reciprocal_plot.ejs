<a class="definition-word" data-category="biochemistry" id="double_inverse_lineweaver_burk_plot_double_reciprocal_plot">Double inverse/Lineweaver-Burk plot/double reciprocal plot</a> - A graphical reprsentation of the Lineweaver-Burk equation used in enzyme cinetics. The plot allows us to derive useful information as to the nature of a <a href="#michaelis_menten_kinetics">Michaelis-Menten</a> type reaction. The reciprocal of the formula is the following:

                        V = \frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m + [S]}

                        \frac{1}{V} = \frac{K_m + [S]}{V_{max}[S]} = \frac{K_m}{V_{max}} \cdot \frac{1}{[S]} + \frac{1}{V_{max}}

                        Note that this equation's simplified form comes out to the form Y = Ax + B. This can be described as a linear curve on a graph as shown.

                        This method can be used to determine enzyme cinetics: K<sub>m</sub>, V<sub>max</sub>. The y-intercept of the graph is equivalent to the inverse of V<sub>max</sub>, and the x-intercept represents -1/KV<sub>m</sub>.
