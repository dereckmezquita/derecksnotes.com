<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="degenerated_primer_library">Degenerated Primer Library</a> - A degenerate primer library is a mix of primers used in <a href="#selex_systematic_evolution_of_ligands_by_exponential_enrichment">SELEX</a>. These primers are obtained by chemical synthesis; note that in chemistry DNA sequences are generated in the reverse sense, 3' → 5'. These primers should contain common regions and "degenerated regions". These degenerated regions are denoted as N; N meaning any of the 4 nucleotides may occupy that spot. Note that if a sequence is ordered with 40N then that would mean that there are <span class="mathsNumbers">4<sup>40</sup> = 1.2 · 10<sup>24</sup></span> different sequences possible. Note the tube received will contain a mixture of all the different possible sequences and not just specific ones.
