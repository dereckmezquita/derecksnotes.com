<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="gibbs_free_energy">Gibbs Free Energy</a> - A state function discovered by Josiah Willard Gibbs called Gibbs Free Energy, Free <a href="#enthalpy">Enthalpy</a>, or G. This function is written at a given temperature as such: \( \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S \).
                    <p><a href="#exothermic">Exothermic</a> reactions are instances where <a href="#heat">heat</a> is liberated from the <a href="#system">system</a>; in this case <a href="#enthalpy">enthalpy</a> is negative (Δ&lt;H). These systems are inherently unstable and thus spontaneous reactions.</p>
                    <p><a href="#endothermic">Endothermic</a> reactions are instances where <a href="#heat">heat</a> is absorbed by the <a href="#system">system</a>; in this case <a href="#enthalpy">enthalpy</a> is positve (Δ&gt;H).</p>
