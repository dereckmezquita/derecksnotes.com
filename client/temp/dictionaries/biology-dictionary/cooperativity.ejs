<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="cooperativity">Cooperativity</a> - The ability for binding events to <a href="#promoter">promote</a> additional binding events. <em>Exempli gratia</em> the binding of the first <a href="#CDic_oxygen">oxygen molecule</a> to <a href="#hemoglobin">hemoglobin</a> makes the binding of the second <a href="#CDic_oxygen">oxygen molecule</a> much more likely, which in turn makes the binding of the third <a href="#molecule">molecule</a> much more likely, <em>et cetera</em>. We often want to use <a href="#repressor">repressors</a> that exhibit cooperativity, as they exhibit a non-linear (<a href="#MDic_exponential">exponential</a>) response useful for creating devices that can be analysed with the digital abstraction.
