They are particularly useful for <a href="#dna_assembly">DNA assembly</a>, as they enable creating arbitrary <a href="#overhang">overhang</a> sequences. Commonly used Type IIs <a href="#enzyme">enzymes</a> include BsaI and BbsI, which are both used in <a href="#golden_gate">Golden Gate</a> or <a href="#moclo">MoClo assembly</a>.
