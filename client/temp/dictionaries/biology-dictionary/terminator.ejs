<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="terminator">Terminator</a> - The process of termination is the stopping of <a href="#transcription">transcription</a>. This occurs due to particular sequences, terminator sequences, within the <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a>. Some terminators cause termination by causing the <a href="#rna">RNA</a> to fold into structures that cause the <a href="#rna_polymerase_rna_p">RNA</a> to release it. Others recruit <a href="#protein">proteins</a> which pull the freshly synthesised (nascent) <a href="#rna">RNA</a> out of the <a href="#rna">RNA</a> <a href="#polymerase">polymerase</a> or cause the release by other mechanisms.
