<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="scaffold">Scaffold</a> - A structure on which elements can be brought together to be close in space. For example, the <a href="#enzyme">enzymes</a> involved in the same pathway can be brought together in proximity on an <a href="#rna">RNA scaffold</a> by fusing the <a href="#enzyme">enzymes</a> with <a href="#rna">RNA</a>-binding <a href="#protein">proteins</a> and thus increase the efficiency of the pathway, as <a href="#substrate">substrates</a> do not need to <a href="#diffusion">diffuse</a> far to reach the next <a href="#enzyme">enzyme</a> in the pathway.
