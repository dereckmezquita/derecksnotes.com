<a class="definition-word" data-category="biochemistry" id="cathodoluminescence">Cathodoluminescence</a> - An analytical technique used in geology and paleontology to analyze the different minerals in a sample, or diagenetic history of a sample â€” how crystals grew, were deformed, and were replaced. A beam of electrons is fired at a sample to produce visible light, which can then be used to interpret the mineralogical and diagenetic history of the sample.
