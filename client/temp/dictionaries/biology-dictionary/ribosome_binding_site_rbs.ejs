<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="ribosome_binding_site_rbs">Ribosome Binding Site (RBS)</a> - A sequence upstream of the start <a href="#codon">codon</a> that recruits <a href="#ribosome">ribosomes</a> and allows <a href="#translation">translation</a>. RBSs are well-defined in <a href="#prokaryote">prokaryotic</a> systems and are also known as Shine-Dalgarno sequences. Recruitment of <a href="#ribosome">ribosomes</a> in <a href="#eukaryota">eukaryotic</a> systems is more complex and less-understood. RBS "strength" is a large factor in <a href="#protein">protein</a> production rate and is determined by local <a href="#rna">RNA</a> <a href="#conformation">secondary</a> and <a href="#conformation">tertiary</a> structure. RBS calculators allow the control of relative <a href="#translation">translation</a> rates across different RBSs.
