<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="5_prime_end_5">5 Prime End (5')</a> - The 5' or 5 prime end of a <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> or <a href="#rna">RNA</a> molecule is the end that holds the terminal phosphate (<sup>-</sup>PO<sub>4</sub>). This allows for the formation of the <a href="#phosphodiesterBond">phosphodiester bond</a> between two <a href="#nucleotide">nucleotides</a>. The other end of a nucleic strand is the <a href="#3_prime_end_3">3' or 3 prime end </a>, which has the hydroxyl group (<sup>-</sup>OH).
