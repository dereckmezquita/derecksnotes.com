<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="restriction_enzyme">Restriction Enzyme</a> - <a href="#enzyme">Enzymes</a> that cut <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> in a site-specific manner. Typically, each restriction enzyme has a certain restriction site that it recognises. Standard restriction enzymes that cut within their recognition site are the basis of traditional <a href="#cloning_molecular_cloning">cloning</a> methods. Type IIS restriction enzymes, such BsaI, cut at a location outside of their recognition site and enable <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> assembly without the producing scar regions. Type IIS restriction enzymes are the basis of <a href="#golden_gate">Golden Gate cloning</a> methods.
