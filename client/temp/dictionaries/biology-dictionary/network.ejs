<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="network">Network</a> - A group of two or more interacting <a href="#subUnit">sub-units</a>. Each <a href="#subUnit">sub-units</a> is called a node and the interactions between nodes are termed edges. Networks can be used to describe many different systems. <a href="#protein">Protein-protein</a> interaction networks have <a href="#protein">proteins</a> as nodes and the edges between them can be binding interactions. Microbiome studies may describe microbial species as nodes and define the edges as influences on growth rate.
