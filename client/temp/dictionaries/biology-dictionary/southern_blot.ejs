<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="southern_blot">Southern Blot</a> - A lab technique used for the detection of specific <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> sequences in a sample. Sothern blotting typically involves a first migration by classic <a href="#electrophoresis">electrophoresis</a> then a "blotting" step by a membrane which uptakes the <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> from the gell, then the probe which is complementary to the strand of interest is introduced. This probe is typically marked by a radioactive strand or an <a href="#antibody">antibody</a>. This reveals if the sequence of interest was found in the sample or not.
