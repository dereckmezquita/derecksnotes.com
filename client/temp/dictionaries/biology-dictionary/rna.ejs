<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="rna">RNA</a> - Ribonucleic acid; <a href="#polymer">polymeric molecules</a> made up of <a href="#nucleotide">nucleotide</a> monomers. RNA has many biological functions from information carrying (<a href="#mrna">mRNA</a>) to <a href="#catalysation">catalytic</a> activity (<a href="#ribozyme">ribozymes</a>); its primary function however, is to transmit information from longterm storage (<a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a>) to active machinery <a href="#protein">proteins</a>. RNA is often found folded unto itself instead of in a <a href="#doubleStrand">double strand</a> type; which is often the case with <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a>. RNA is composed of 4 different kinds of <a href="#nucleotide">nucleotides</a> with the <a href="#nitrogenous_base">nitrogenous bases</a>: A (Adenine), U (Uracil), C (Cytosine), and G (Guanine). RNA notably contains U instead of T (thymine) as <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> does. RNA also does not contain <a href="#desoxyribose">desoxyribose</a> as <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> does but <a href="#ribose">ribose</a> instead. The 18S <a href="#rrna">ribosomal RNA</a> sequence has been used in many groups of organisms to reconstruct <a href="#phylogeny">phylogeny</a>.
