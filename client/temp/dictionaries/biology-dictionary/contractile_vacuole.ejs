<a class="definition-word" data-category="cellular-biology" id="contractile_vacuole">Contractile Vacuole</a> - In many protists, a specialised vacuole with associated channels designed to collect excess water in the cell. Microtubules periodically contract to force this excess water out of the cell, regulating the cell's osmotic balance.
