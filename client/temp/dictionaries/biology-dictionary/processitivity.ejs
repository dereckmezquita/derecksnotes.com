<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="processitivity">Processitivity</a> - An <a href="#enzyme">enzyme</a> is processive if it acts on a <a href="#polymer">polymeric substrate</a> and <a href="#catalysation">catalyses</a> a reaction on several of the monomeric <a href="#Subunit">subunits</a> after binding the <a href="#polymer">polymer</a>. For example, <a href="#dna_polymerase">DNA polymerase</a> is a processive enzyme, as it binds the <a href="#primer">primer-template</a> complex and then proceeds to create a new strand of <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> by moving along the template. Higher processivity means that the <a href="#enzyme">enzyme</a> stays and acts on the <a href="#polymer">polymer</a> for longer. <em>Exempli gratia</em> a <a href="#dna_polymerase">DNA polymerase</a> can process thousands of <a href="#nucleotide">nucleotides</a> after a single binding event. Other processive <a href="#enzyme">enzymes</a> include some <a href="#exonuclease">exonucleases</a> which constantly chew up the <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a>, base by base and <a href="#helicase">helicases</a> which unwind double-stranded <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a>.
