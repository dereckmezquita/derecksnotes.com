<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="ahl">AHL</a> - They are a class of homoserine lactones with an acyl group. These are small <a href="#molecule">molecules</a> that can <a href="#diffusion">diffuse</a> between cells. They typically act as a <a href="#quorum_sensing">quorum sensing</a> and <a href="#signal">signaling molecule</a> as it can <a href="#diffusion">diffuse</a> throughout a <a href="#bacterial_colony">bacterial population</a> such that the knowledge of the <a href="#concentration">concentration</a> of the AHL is shared between all <a href="#bacteria">bacteria</a>. The <a href="#bacteria">bacteria</a> can detect the AHL <a href="#concentration">concentration</a> by way of a <a href="#transcription_factor_tf">transcription factor</a> that can bind and be modulated by the AHL molecule. For example, the <a href="#lux_system_luxi_luxr">LuxI gene</a> produces an AHL that can then bind <a href="#lux_system_luxi_luxr">LuxR</a>, relieving its <a href="#repressor">repressor</a> on the corresponding <a href="#promoter">promoter</a>.
