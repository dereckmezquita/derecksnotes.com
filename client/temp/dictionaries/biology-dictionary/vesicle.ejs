<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="vesicle">Vesicle</a> - Vesicles are <a href="#lipidBilayer">lipid bilayer</a> structures that contain liquid and materials of interest. <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a>, <a href="#rna">RNA</a> and <a href="#protein">proteins</a> can all be delivered to cultured cells using vesicles created in a mixture of the desired payload. As the vesicles form, they encapsulate the <a href="#nucleic_acid">nucleic acids</a> and <a href="#protein">proteins</a> in the mixture. The vesicles can merge with the cell outer layer or be <a href="#endocytosis">endocytosed</a>, both leading to the delivery of the payload (though through different biological mechanisms). Reagents are commercially available for this purpose, optimised for different payload types, amounts, and sizes.
