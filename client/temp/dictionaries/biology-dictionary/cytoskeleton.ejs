<a class="definition-word" data-category="cellular-biology" id="cytoskeleton">Cytoskeleton</a> - Integrated system of molecules within eukaryotic cells which provides them with shape, internal spatial organization, motility, and may assist in communication with other cells and the environment. Red blood cells, for instance, would be spherical instead of flat if it were not for their cytoskeleton.
