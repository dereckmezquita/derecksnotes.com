<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="2d_electrophoresis">2D Electrophoresis</a> - A 2D electrophoresis, is a variant of the <a href="#electrophoresis">electrophoresis</a> lab method. Usually the first <a href="#electrophoresis">electrophoresis</a> is done to migrate proteins based on their mobility which is dependent on the charge/mass ratio. Then a second migration is done in the other dimension, or perpendicular to the first; now migrating the proteins based on their <a href="#potential_hydrogen_isoelectric_point_phi">potential hydrogen isoelectric point (pHi)</a>. By doing this we can reveal different proteins that might have been hidden all in one band.
