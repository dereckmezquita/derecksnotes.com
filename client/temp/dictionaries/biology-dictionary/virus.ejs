<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="virus">Virus</a> - A virus can be simply explained as a <a href="#protein">protein</a> and <a href="#gene">genetic</a> material complex. These are pseudoorganisms and there is much debate as to whether they should or not be classified as living. Viruses have no metabolism and are incapable or reproduction without parasitic use of a <a href="#host">host cell</a>'s biological machinery. Some viruses may contain <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> or <a href="#rna">RNA</a> in the case of <a href="#rna">RNA</a> it may be either <a href="#positive_rna_rna">positive RNA</a> or negative.
                    <p>Viruses are complex "organisms" with a variety of forms, shapes, and sizes. Some present simple parasitic cycles while others integrate completely into the <a href="#host">host</a>'s <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> as HIV does.
