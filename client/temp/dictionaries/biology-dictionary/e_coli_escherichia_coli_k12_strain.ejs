<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="e_coli_escherichia_coli_k12_strain"><em>E. coli, Escherichia coli K12 Strain</em></a> - The <a href="#strain">strains</a> based on the <a href="#e_coli_escherichia_coli_k12_strain">K-12 strain</a> cannot colonise the human gut and can thus be safely used as organisms in the lab; biosafety level 1 containment, the lowest level. It is for the simple build, fast replication, and banality of the K12 strain that <em>E. coli</em> and especially the K12 strain is favoured by laboratories across the world.
