<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="aptamer">Aptamer</a> - A sequence of <a href="#rna">RNA</a> (or sometimes <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a>) that folds into a particular 3D structure, enabling it to bind some <a href="#ligand">ligand molecule</a>, <em>exempli gratia</em> caffeine, with high <a href="#specificity">specificity</a> and strength. Binding of the <a href="#ligand">ligand</a> can sometimes induce a <a href="#conformation">conformational change</a> in the aptamer, which can be used as a signal for the binding event in the case of aptamer-based circuits.
