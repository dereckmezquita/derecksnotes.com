<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="oligo_oligomer_oligonucleotide">Oligo (Oligomer/Oligonucleotide)</a> - Short <a href="#polymer">polymers</a> of <a href="#nucleotide">nucleotides</a> usually less than 200 <a href="#nucleotide">nucleotides</a> in length. They are typically chemically synthesized and have many uses in biotechnology. <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> oligos can be used as <a href="#primer">primers</a> for <a href="#polymerase_chain_reaction_pcr">PCR</a>, targets in <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> microarrays, and as probes for <a href="#southern_blot">Southern blots</a>. Oligonucleotides can also refer to very short strands of <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> composed of some 10 <a href="#nucleotide">nucleotides</a>.
