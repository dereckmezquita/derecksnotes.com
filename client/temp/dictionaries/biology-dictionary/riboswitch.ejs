<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="riboswitch">Riboswitch</a> - A <a href="#trans_cis">cis</a>-acting regulatory element found in <a href="#mrna">mRNA</a> transcripts. Riboswitches form structures whose <a href="#conformation">conformations</a> are affected by small <a href="#molecule">molecules</a>. These <a href="#conformation">conformational</a> changes have the ability to turn expression of a transcript "ON" or "OFF". This switching is accomplished through a variety of mechanisms.
