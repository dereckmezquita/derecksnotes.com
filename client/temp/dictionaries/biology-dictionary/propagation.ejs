<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="propagation">Propagation</a> - In terms of <a href="#plasmid">plasmids</a>, propagation is the ability of a <a href="#plasmid">plasmid</a> to be replicated by its <a href="#host">host</a> organism. A properly-propagating <a href="#plasmid">plasmid</a> will have an <a href="#origin_of_replication_ori">origin of replication</a> that is able to recruit the <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> replication machinery of the organism. A <a href="#plasmid">plasmid</a> that does not propagate will ultimately be diluted out of a replicating <a href="#cellLine">cell line</a> due to cellular divisions.
