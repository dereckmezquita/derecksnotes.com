<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="rna_binding_protein_rna_bp">RNA Binding Protein (RNA-BP)</a> - A <a href="#protein">protein</a> that binds to an <a href="#rna">RNA</a> sequence as its substrate. Naturally, these <a href="#protein">proteins</a> serve a variety of roles in post-<a href="#transcription">transcriptional</a> regulation. Recently, bacteriophage coat <a href="#protein">proteins</a> such as PP7 and MS2 have been used to target <a href="#rna">RNA</a> sequences that have had RBP binding sites integrated into them. Fusion of these RBPs to <a href="#green_fluorescent_protein_gfp_egfp">fluorescent proteins</a> allows the real-time monitoring of <a href="#mrna">mRNA</a> <a href="#transcription">transcription</a>.
