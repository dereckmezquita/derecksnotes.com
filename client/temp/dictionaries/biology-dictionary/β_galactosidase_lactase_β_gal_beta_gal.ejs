<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="β_galactosidase_lactase_β_gal_beta_gal">β-Galactosidase (lactase, β-gal, beta-gal)</a> - Is a glycoside hydrolase enzyme which catalyses the breakdown of β-galactosides into monosaccharides. It is commonly used in molecular biology as a <a href="#reporter">reporter gene</a> to monitor gene expression. Microorganisms, or other, producing this enzyme can break down <a href="#x_gal">x-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside)</a>, an artificial chromogenic substrate. Cleavage of this substrate produces a blue colour. It can be mixed in <a href="#petri_dish">petri dishes</a>; known as <a href="#blueWhiteScreening">blue/white screening</a>.
                    <p>
                        This enzyme can be split into two complimentary peptides LacZα and LacZΩ; neither active by itself but together can break down <a href="#x_gal">x-gal</a>.
