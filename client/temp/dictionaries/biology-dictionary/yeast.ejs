<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="yeast">Yeast</a> - A class of mostly <a href="#unicellular">unicellular</a> <a href="#eukaryota">eukaryotic</a> organisms. These easy-to-culture organisms are often used in biology and <a href="#synthetic_biology">synthetic biology</a> as test organisms or chassis. Commonly used yeast species include <a href="#sachharomyces_cerevisiae"><em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em></a> (brewer's yeast or baker's yeast; unlike other <a href="#eukaryota">eukaryotes</a> it is missing the <a href="#rna_interference_rnai">RNAi</a> machinery). Some notable species are <em>Kluyveromyces lactis</em> which can convert lactose to lactic acid, and <em>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</em> fission yeast; this yeast has <a href="#rna_interference_rnai">RNAi</a> machinery.
