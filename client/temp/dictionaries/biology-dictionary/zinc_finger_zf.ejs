<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="zinc_finger_zf">Zinc Finger (ZF)</a> - A <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> binding protein motif, often seen in <a href="#transcription_factor_tf">transcription factors</a>. In the folded motif, a zinc ion is coordinated by <a href="#amino_acid">amino acid</a> helices and sheets. Many motifs bind sequence-specifically (3-4 <a href="#base_pair_bp">base pairs</a>) and can be combined together to bind longer sequences (9-12 basepairs). While a "code" exist (mapping of motifs to sequences), technologies like <a href="#taleS">TALEs</a> or <a href="#crispr_cas9">CRISPR/Cas9</a> are often preferred for engineering <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> binding <a href="#protein">proteins</a>, as the code is more clear and specific in these; increasing the rate of success.
