<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="rna_interference_rnai">RNA Interference (RNAi)</a> - A biological process by which <a href="#doubleStrand">double-stranded</a> <a href="#rna">RNA</a> (dsRNA) <a href="#inhibitor">inhibits</a> the expression of <a href="#gene">genes</a> complementary to its sequence. <a href="#rna_interference_rnai">RNAi</a> is thought to have evolved as a defense against <a href="#virus">viruses</a> (some of which have dsRNA genomes) and it has been shown to have an important role during development. This system can also be exploited to induce artificial gene knockdown through the introduction of synthetic dsRNAs or <a href="#vector">vectors</a> that express <a href="#sirna">siRNAs</a>.
                    <p>While most <a href="#eukaryota">eukaryotes</a> have <a href="#rna_interference_rnai">RNAi</a> machinery, <a href="#sachharomyces_cerevisiae"><em>S. cerevisiae</em></a> notably lacks it. <a href="#prokaryote">Prokaryotes</a> also do not possess <a href="#rna_interference_rnai">RNAi</a> machinery.</p>
