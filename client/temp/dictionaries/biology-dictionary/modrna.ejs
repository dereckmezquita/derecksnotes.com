<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="modrna">modRNA</a> - Modified <a href="#mrna">mRNA</a>. Synthetic, chemically-modified <a href="#mrna">mRNA</a> that can be transfected into <a href="#cell">cells</a> to induce expression of a <a href="#protein">protein</a> of interest. Chemical modifications at the <a href="#5_prime_end_5">5'</a> end allow the <a href="#transcription">transcript</a> to evade harmful immune responses and prevent it from being degraded thus allowing prolonged protein expression.
