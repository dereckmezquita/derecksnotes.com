<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="tight_junction">Tight junction</a> - Intercellular structure which forms an almost perfect continuous seal between two adjacent <a href="#epithelium">epithelial cells</a> close to their <a href="#apical">apical</a> (side which faces the lumen) side. The tightness of the seal may vary depending on the kind of <a href="#epithelium">epithelium</a>. It acts as a filter which lets water and some other <a href="#ion">ions</a> come through and into the organism. These tight junctions are also important in halting the <a href="#diffusion">diffusion</a> of <a href="#protein">proteins</a> and cytoplasmique glycolipids from the <a href="#apical">apical</a> side of the <a href="#cell">cell</a> to the <a href="#basolateral">basolateral</a> side.
