<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="anneal">Anneal</a> - In the context of <a href="#dna_assembly">DNA assembly</a> this means the coming together of <a href="#complementary">complementary</a> (or <a href="#complementary">near-complementary</a>, in some cases) sequences of <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a>. This is often assisted by a change in temperature: two <a href="#complementary">complementary sequences</a> are often heated up (to say 95Â°C) and then allowed to cool down. The heating removes self-annealing, which causes <a href="#secondary_structure">secondary structures</a> to form in the <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a>, which might <a href="#inhibitor">inhibit</a> annealing to the other <a href="#molecule">molecule</a>. The cooling down allows the formation of <a href="#hydrogenBond">hydrogen bonds</a> between the two <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> strands. The opposite process to annealing is melting or <a href="#denature">denaturing</a> of <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a>, which happens at high temperatures.
