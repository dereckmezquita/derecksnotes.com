<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="timescale_separation">Timescale Separation</a> - A method for simplifying time-dependent systems. It is often the case that a system has processes which have timescales (how long it takes for the system to reach <a href="#equilibrium">equilibrium</a>) differing by one or more orders of magnitude. For example, the timescale of <a href="#transcription_factor_tf">transcription factors</a> binding to <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> is short, as the binding <a href="#equilibrium">equilibrium</a> is reached within milliseconds or less. However, the process of producing a mature <a href="#protein">protein</a> can take minutes or more. Hence, when analysing a system where both processes occur, the binding can be considered to be at <a href="#equilibrium">equilibrium</a> when discussing how <a href="#protein">protein</a> dynamics look.
