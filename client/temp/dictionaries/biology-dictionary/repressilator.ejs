<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="repressilator">Repressilator</a> - One of the earliest oscillating synthetic circuits published by Elowitz and Leibler in 2000. It accomplishes oscillations through the use of a three-repressor ring oscillator circuit topology. The circuit was able to oscillate, but had issues with robustness.
