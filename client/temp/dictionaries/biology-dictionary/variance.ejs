<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="variance">Variance</a> - A statistical measure describing the spread of a random variable around its mean. A tight distribution has small variance and thus most of the values are close to the mean. The variance is related to the standard deviation by \( Var(x) = \sigma^2 \) Mathematically, <span class="mathsNumbers">\( Var(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2] \);</span> the variance is the expectation of the square of the difference of the random variable from its mean. The variance can also be calculated by taking the difference of the expectation of the square of the variable and the expectation of the variable, squared:
