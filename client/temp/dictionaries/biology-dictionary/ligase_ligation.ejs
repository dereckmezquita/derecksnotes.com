<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="ligase_ligation">Ligase, Ligation</a> - A ligase is an <a href="#enzyme">enzyme</a> that <a href="#catalysation">catalyses</a> the formation of a covalent bond between large <a href="#molecule">molecules</a>, <em>exempli gratia</em> <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> or <a href="#rna">RNA</a>, for which it catalyses the formation of the phosphodiester bond in the backbone of the nucleic acid <a href="#polymer">polymer</a> Ligases can use single-stranded or <a href="#doubleStrand">double-stranded</a> (more common) <a href="#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid">DNA</a> (or even <a href="#rna">RNA</a>) as the <a href="#substrate">substrate</a> but are often <a href="#substrate">substrate</a> to the type of <a href="#substrate">substrate</a>, while not being sequence-specific. All commonly used ligases require a <strong>5'</strong> phosphate group on the <a href="#substrate">substrate</a>, which is absent from most synthetic <a href="#oligonucleotide">oligonucleotides</a> and thus have to be specifically ordered as such or enzymatically phosphorylated with a <a href="#pnk">poly-nucleotide kinase (PNK)</a>.
