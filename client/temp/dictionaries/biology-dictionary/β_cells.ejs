<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="β_cells">β-Cells</a> - β-cells are a type of <a href="#cell">cell</a> found in the pancreas, the pancreatic islets more precisely. These <a href="#cell">cells</a> are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of <a href="#insulin">insulin</a> and <a href="#amylin">amylin</a>.
                    <p>
                        They make up around 50 - 70% of all the cells in the islets. People with type-I diabetes have their β-cells iradicated and thus produce no insulin.
