<a class="definition-word" data-category="general-biology" id="linker">Linker</a> - A linker sequence is inserted between two <a href="#protein">proteins</a> in a translational fusion in order to allow the two proteins to fold independently. This sequence is typically made of glycines and/or lysines, which are relatively flexible residues, forming a loose chain between the two <a href="#protein">protein</a> domains.
