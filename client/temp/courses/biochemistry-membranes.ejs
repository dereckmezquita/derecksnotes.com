    Membranes can be seen as solutions with two dimensions, they are made by a lipid bilayer and contain membranary
    proteins. Thus a lipid bilayer can be seen as the solvant for membranary proteins.
</p>
<h2>Movements of lipids</h2>
<p>
    It is possible for molecules in the lipid bilayer to move in two dimensions generally, this is known as lateral
    diffusion. But movement in other dimensions is also possible, listed below:
