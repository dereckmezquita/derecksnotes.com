            <h2>Life</h2>
            <p>
                Isaac Newton was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, and alchemist. He was born on 25 December 1642 and died on 20 March 1726/27 at the age of 84. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential and revolutionary scientists in history.
            </p>
            <p>
                Newton is best known for his laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation. These laws describe the behavior of objects in motion and the force of gravity, respectively. He also made major contributions to the field of optics, including the discovery that white light is composed of different colors.

                Newton's most famous work is "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy," published in 1687. This work is considered one of the most important scientific works in history. It contains his laws of motion and law of universal gravitation. I will only briefly descuss these laws here.

            <h3>Law of Universal Gravitation</h3>
            <p>
                One of Isaac Newton's most famous contributions to science is his law of universal gravitation. This law states that every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force pointing along a line intersecting both points. The force is the inverse square of the distance between the two masses, and is given by the following equation:
            </p>
            <div class="mathsFormulas">
                $$
                F = G \frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}
                $$
            </div>
            <p>
                where F is the force of attraction between the two masses, m1 and m2 are the masses, r is the distance between the two masses, and G is the gravitational constant.
            </p>
            <p>
                What does that mean? In simple terms: the strength of the force between two masses becomes less strong as the distance between them increases.
            </p>
            <p>
                This law of universal gravitation provided the first explanation for the observed motions of the planets and revolutionised our understanding of the universe. It showed that the same physical laws govern the motion of celestial bodies as well as objects on Earth, and helped establish the idea of a single, coherent physical universe.
            </p>

            <h3>Laws of Motion</h3>
            <p>
                Isaac Newton's laws of motion describe the behavior of objects in motion and provide the foundation for classical mechanics. There are three laws:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The first law states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will remain in motion with a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The second law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object and inversely proportional to its mass.
                </li>
                <div class="mathsFormulas">
                    $$
                    F = ma
                    $$
                </div>
                <li>
                    The third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                These laws of motion provided the basis for our understanding of the motion of objects and helped establish the idea of a mathematical description of the physical world. They are still used today in fields such as engineering, physics, and astronomy.
            </p>

                In addition to his work in physics and mathematics, Newton was also interested in alchemy and theology. He wrote extensively on these subjects, although much of his work in these areas remains unpublished.
            </p>
            <p>
                Newton is also famous for his supposed connection to the apple that supposedly fell on his head, inspiring him to think about the force of gravity. While the story is likely a myth, it highlights the impact that Newton's work had on popular imagination.
            </p>
            <p>
                Newton's work laid the foundation for modern physics and mathematics, and he is considered one of the greatest scientists of all time. His laws of motion and law of universal gravitation form the basis of classical mechanics. He was also a key figure in the Scientific Revolution, which saw a shift away from the Aristotelian view of the natural world towards a more empirical and mathematical approach.
