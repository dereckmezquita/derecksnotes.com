            <h1>Music theory: Sharps and Flats</h1>
            <p>
                Today I learned the following regarding musical notes. There is a simple diagram that can be used in order to keep track of all notes, from normals to sharps and flats. The image is shown below:

                <figcaption>All possible notes displayed in a circle diagram.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                What this diagram tells us is that the standard notes are the following: <strong>A, B, C, D, E, F, G</strong>. Moreover there are sharp and flat versions between every single note except <strong>B - C</strong> and <strong>E - F</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                These sharps and flats are referred to as <strong>half-steps</strong>. On a guitar neck every increment in fret that is taken is increasing by one <strong>half-step</strong>. Thus if starting on the <strong>E</strong> string, open is <strong>E</strong>, fret 1 is <strong>F</strong>, then <strong>F#</strong> and so on, until the wheel is complete and we are back at <strong>E</strong> (12 steps down). This is what is referred to as the next octave.
