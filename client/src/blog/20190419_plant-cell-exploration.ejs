                Some video I filmed a while ago. This was filmed using an Optico Paris microscope, at 40x, 100x, 400x, and 1000x magnification (oil lens). An exploration of plant cells, specifically orchid parts including: roots, and leaves.

                Note that the multiple (number) displayed on screen (bottom right) at some sequences indicates that the video was sped up.
