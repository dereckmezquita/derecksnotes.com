            <p>
                Welcome to this library of definitions for biology; from the molecular to the macroscopic. This dictionary should serve only as a quick reference and offers short explicative definitions as refreshers or introductions to core concepts in biology. Please do not hesitate to signal any error or suggestion you may have, feel free to use any of the available contact forms on the site with the subject definition and the word you are referencing.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the moment if you are arriving from a website search please simply use the command/control + f to quickly find and reference the desired definition. Hyperlinks are also activated between definitions and other pages on this website

Stable isotopes are atomic variations of elements that are stable over long periods of time, meaning they do not radioactively decay. Several elements, like oxygen and carbon, have several stable forms. Oxygen, for example, occurs in nature as <sup>16</sup>O and <sup>18</sup>O — these two forms are isotopes. They have different numbers of neutrons (<sup>16</sup>O has two more neutrons than <sup>18</sup>O), and and is therefore heavier. Because the two isotopes have different masses, chemical and physical reactions like bonding, evaporation, and precipitation occur at different frequencies. The ratio of stable isotopes is preserved in chemical compounds like water, ice, and calcium carbonate and provides information on the environmental conditions at the time the compound formed. For example, the ratio of <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O in an ice sample is linked to the water temperature of ancient oceans, which in turn reflects ancient climates.
