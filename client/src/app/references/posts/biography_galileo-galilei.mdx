Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) was an Italian natural philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer who played a pivotal role in the Scientific Revolution. Through his systematic experimentation, telescope-based discoveries, and advocacy of heliocentrism, Galileo helped transform our understanding of motion, celestial bodies, and the nature of scientific inquiry itself.

## Early Life and Education

Galileo was born on 15 February 1564 in Pisa, then part of the Duchy of Florence. His father, Vincenzo Galilei, was a musician and music theorist who encouraged his son to pursue intellectual interests. Initially intending to study medicine at the University of Pisa, Galileo soon discovered his passion for mathematics and natural philosophy. Under the mentorship of mathematicians such as Ostilio Ricci, Galileo began exploring geometry, astronomy, and mechanics.

## Path to Scientific Prominence

Despite facing financial difficulties, Galileo obtained a teaching post at the University of Pisa (1589-1592) and then at the University of Padua (1592-1610). It was during his years at Padua that he made significant strides in physics and began investigating projectile motion and kinematics. Around the same time, news of telescopes reached Italy, and Galileo swiftly constructed his own versions—of superior magnification—for astronomical observations.

### The Telescope and Celestial Observations

In 1609, Galileo turned his telescope skyward. Through meticulous observation, he revealed:

- The craters and mountains of the Moon, undermining the Aristotelian belief in perfect celestial spheres.
- Four satellites orbiting Jupiter (now called the Galilean moons).
- The phases of Venus, providing powerful evidence that planets revolve around the Sun rather than the Earth.

These findings supported the heliocentric model proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus, challenging prevailing geocentric doctrines upheld by many scholars and church authorities of the time.

## Key Discoveries and Works

1. **Sidereus Nuncius (1610)**  
   This short treatise documented Galileo's early telescopic discoveries—Venus's phases, Jupiter's moons, and the irregular surface of the Moon—shattering centuries of assumptions about a pristine heavens.

2. **Letters on Sunspots (1613)**  
   Galileo detailed observations of dark patches on the Sun's surface, rotating and changing, further indicating celestial bodies were not immutable but subject to transformation.

3. **Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632)**  
   Arguably Galileo's most famous work, the Dialogue presented arguments for and against Copernican heliocentrism in the form of a lively debate. Though formally balanced, the Dialogue was perceived as strongly favouring the heliocentric view, drawing the ire of the Inquisition.

## Motion and Mechanics

Galileo pioneered a quantitative approach to motion, emphasising experiments and mathematics over purely philosophical reasoning. He laid the groundwork for Newtonian mechanics by studying falling bodies and projectile motion.

### Falling Bodies and Inclined Planes

By using inclined planes to slow the acceleration of rolling spheres, Galileo measured distances covered over equal intervals of time. He concluded:

- Objects in free fall near Earth's surface accelerate uniformly, regardless of their mass.
- Distance travelled under constant acceleration follows:
  $$
  s \;=\; \frac{1}{2}\,g\,t^2,
  $$
  where $ g $ is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately $ 9.8\text{ m/s}^2 $ near Earth's surface) and $ t $ is the time elapsed.

### Projectile Motion Demonstration

Galileo was among the first to recognise that projectile paths are parabolic if we neglect air resistance. Consider a projectile launched horizontally with initial velocity $ v_0 $. Its position at time $ t $ can be described as:

- **Horizontal direction**:  
  $$
  x \;=\; v_0 \, t,
  $$
  because no horizontal acceleration acts (in the idealised case).
- **Vertical direction**:  
  $$
  y \;=\; -\,\frac{1}{2}\,g\,t^2,
  $$
  assuming downward is negative and the initial vertical velocity is zero.

Combining these yields a parabola:

$$
y \;=\; -\,\frac{g}{2\,v_0^2}\,x^2.
$$

By systematically measuring distances and times, Galileo elevated the study of motion to a quantitative science, paving the way for Isaac Newton's laws of motion.

## Conflict with the Church

Galileo's advocacy of the heliocentric model led to a confrontation with the Roman Catholic Church. In 1633, under suspicion of heresy, he was found 'vehemently suspect of heresy' and compelled to recant his support for the Copernican system. He lived the remainder of his life under house arrest, although he continued his scientific investigations, even exploring early ideas of pendulum-based clocks.

## Later Years and Legacy

Galileo's final major work, 'Two New Sciences' (1638), reviewed his lifelong research on strength of materials and the study of motion. By this time, failing health and poor eyesight limited his activities, though his experimental approach remained influential. Galileo died on 8 January 1642 in Arcetri, near Florence.

His unwavering commitment to empirical observation and mathematical rigour revolutionised natural philosophy. Modern science credits Galileo with founding the 'experimental method'—a prototype for how future investigators would systematically probe reality.

Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes... but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written.

Through telescopic discoveries, deep analysis of motion, and unshakeable belief in observation over mere tradition, Galileo helped lay the foundations of modern physics and astronomy. His relentless pursuit of truth, despite facing institutional opposition, stands as a testament to the power of evidence-based inquiry and the enduring value of scientific courage.
