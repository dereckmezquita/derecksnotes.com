## Life

Gregor Johann Mendel (1822-1884) is widely celebrated as the “father of modern genetics.” Yet during his lifetime, his pioneering work on heredity was largely overlooked, as the scientific community was not ready to accept the profound conclusions he drew from his meticulous experiments. Over the course of more than a decade, Mendel patiently bred and studied multiple plant species—most famously peas.

Mendel was born on 22 July 1822 in Hynčice (now Heinzendorf bei Odrau), a small village in the region that was then part of the Austrian Empire, which corresponds to today's Czech Republic. In 1840, he began his studies at the Institute of Philosophy in Olomouc with the goal of ultimately attending university. Due to financial constraints, however, Mendel joined the Noviciate at the Brno Monastery and was ordained a priest in 1848.

Encouraged by the abbot, Cyrill Napp, Mendel pursued further academic training, leaving in 1851 to study at Johann Christian's Institute of Physics. There he immersed himself in a range of subjects—botany, plant physiology, entomology, palaeontology, and even experimental physics. During his time at the institute, Mendel came under the influence of Franz Unger, a professor of plant physiology whose work on hybridisation and trait inheritance sparked Mendel's own interest in understanding how characteristics are passed from one generation to another.[^1][^2]

## Works

After returning to the Brno Monastery, Mendel set his sights on experimenting with pea plants (*Pisum sativum*, though sometimes previously recorded as *P. caccharatum*). He focused on seven distinct traits, each with two observable forms:

### Mendel's Experiments

In his initial experiments, Mendel crossed two pea varieties differing in just one trait (monohybrid crosses). For instance, he bred smooth seeded plants with wrinkled seeded plants. The first generation (F₁) invariably displayed only one of the parental forms—in the smooth vs. wrinkled example, all F₁ seeds were smooth (i.e., 100% smooth phenotype).

Mendel then took the F₁ plants and self fertilised them (often called “autofecondation”), producing the second (F₂) generation. Here, the wrinkled trait reappeared in roughly 25% of the seeds. Mendel observed a characteristic 3:1 ratio in these monohybrid crosses. He deduced that the “hidden” wrinkled trait in the F₁ plants was not lost but masked, coining what we now call “recessive” genes.

### Mendel's Laws

From these observations, Mendel concluded that each hybrid offspring receives a “factor” (what we now call an allele) from each parent for each trait. This finding overturned older notions of blended inheritance, establishing instead that a trait can be present without necessarily appearing in every generation. This reasoning laid out what later generations of scientists would call Mendel's First Law—the “Law of Dominance.”

Encouraged by his success, Mendel moved on to experiments involving more than one trait at a time (dihybrid and polyhybrid crosses). These additional studies led to the articulation of two more fundamental laws of heredity:

1. **Law of Segregation**: Each pair of alleles separates during gamete formation, and each gamete carries only one allele for each trait.  
2. **Law of Independent Assortment**: The segregation of alleles for one trait is independent of that for another trait (except in cases of linkage, which was clarified much later).

## Key Contributions and Legacy

1. **Foundation of Modern Genetics**  
   Mendel's identification of dominant and recessive alleles, along with his systematic approach to crossing plants with distinct traits, marked the birth of genetics as a formal scientific discipline. His findings on inheritance patterns provided the groundwork for the discovery of genes and later the molecular underpinnings of DNA.

2. **Mathematical Approach in Biology**  
   One of Mendel's most significant contributions was his application of quantitative methods, including combinatorial mathematics and probability, to biological data. This empirical and statistical approach foreshadowed the scientific method employed in modern genetics and genomics.

3. **Ignored Then Celebrated**  
   Despite the groundbreaking nature of his results, Mendel's work went largely unnoticed by the scientific community of his day. It was only rediscovered around 1900 by three separate botanists—Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns, and Erich von Tschermak—who independently arrived at inheritance patterns that mirrored Mendel's observations.

4. **Influence on Molecular Genetics**  
   Mendel's concept of discrete “factors” that determine traits paved the way for the identification of genes on chromosomes in the early 20th century. Later milestones, such as Watson and Crick's discovery of the DNA double helix, built upon the basic Mendelian framework of how traits are inherited.

## End of Life

After some ten years of rigorous experimentation and a largely unheeded publication, Mendel gradually withdrew from his genetic studies to fulfil greater religious responsibilities. He became superior of his monastery, shifting his focus away from heredity. From around 1856, he developed a passion for meteorology, conducting observations and measurements for the remainder of his life. Mendel passed away in 1884, his brilliant work still unrecognised by the broader scientific community.

It is a testament to Mendel's genius that when his work was finally rediscovered at the dawn of the 20th century, it provided the foundation upon which the entire modern field of genetics was built—ensuring that his legacy lives on in every experiment exploring the secrets of heredity.
