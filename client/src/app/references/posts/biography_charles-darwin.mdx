Charles Robert Darwin (1809-1882) was an English naturalist and biologist whose theory of evolution by natural selection redefined our understanding of life on Earth. His carefully gathered evidence, spanning decades of observation and experimentation, showed how species adapt and diverge over long periods. Darwin's final resting place is in Westminster Abbey, where he lies among other luminaries, including Isaac Newton.

## Early Life and Education

Darwin was born on 12 February 1809 in Shrewsbury, England, into a family of physicians and intellectuals. His grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, was a noted thinker, and his father, Robert Darwin, was a wealthy doctor who initially steered Charles toward a medical career. Young Darwin, however, found medical training at the University of Edinburgh off-putting. Eventually, he enrolled at Christ's College, Cambridge, aiming for a career in the clergy but simultaneously nurturing an interest in natural history.

At Cambridge, Darwin befriended key figures such as John Stevens Henslow (a botanist) and Adam Sedgwick (a geologist). Their influence drew him deeper into the study of natural sciences. Upon graduation, Darwin was offered a place on HMS Beagle for a survey expedition around the world (1831-1836). This voyage catalysed Darwin's lifelong pursuit of understanding how species form and change.

## Voyage of the Beagle and Observations

During the five-year Beagle voyage, Darwin meticulously documented geology, flora, and fauna from South America to the Galápagos Islands. Key observations included:

- **Fossils and Layers**: He encountered extinct mammal fossils (e.g., giant armadillos) in proximity to living relatives, hinting that species might alter or vanish over time.  
- **Galápagos Finches**: Darwin noted slight variations in finch beaks, seemingly shaped by different island environments, reflecting an adaptive divergence that would guide his evolutionary thinking.  
- **Biogeography**: Patterns of species distribution prompted questions about common ancestry and migration why were certain animals confined to specific regions?

These data, alongside Darwin's reading of Thomas Malthus' work on population pressures, set the theoretical groundwork for natural selection.

## Key Works and Contributions

### 1. On the Origin of Species (1859)

In his most influential publication, Darwin articulated how populations evolve through the process of natural selection:

- **Overproduction**: Organisms produce more offspring than can survive.  
- **Variation**: Individuals exhibit variations in traits.  
- **Competition**: Resources limit population growth, creating a 'struggle for existence.'  
- **Survival of the Fittest**: Those with advantageous traits reproduce more successfully, passing on those traits.  
- **Descent with Modification**: Over generations, small changes can accumulate, leading to new species.

The book caused widespread debate, challenging prevailing views on the immutability of species and prompting fierce discussions about humanity's place in nature.

### 2. The Descent of Man (1871)

Darwin extended his evolutionary arguments to humankind, proposing that humans and other primates share a common ancestor. He discussed sexual selection where traits are favoured not only by survival advantage but also by competition for mates and argued for a continuous spectrum linking humans to other animals.

### 3. Other Works

- **The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication (1868)**: Explored how artificial selection parallels natural selection.  
- **The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872)**: Investigated behavioural and emotional continuity across species.

## Personal Life and Outlook

Darwin married his cousin, Emma Wedgwood, in 1839. They had ten children, some of whom contributed to his research by assisting with experiments in their home. Darwin struggled with poor health, believed to be stress-related or possibly linked to tropical diseases from the Beagle voyage. Despite bouts of illness, he remained steadfast in collecting data, corresponding widely with scientists, and refining his theories.

His rural home at Down House in Kent provided a tranquil environment for experimentation, from cross-pollinating plants to studying earthworms. In many respects, Darwin was a cautious, methodical scientist, gathering mountains of evidence before publishing major theories.

## Legacy and Westminster Resting Place

Charles Darwin died on 19 April 1882. Owing to his stature in science, he was accorded the honour of burial in Westminster Abbey, near the final resting places of Sir Isaac Newton and other luminaries. Today, Darwin's evolutionary framework underpins disciplines ranging from molecular genetics and ecology to anthropology and medicine.

Darwin's perseverance in synthesising mountains of natural evidence into a coherent, testable theory remains a hallmark of the scientific method. His recognition of life's shared history illuminated by small variations shaped by natural selection offers a unifying narrative for biology. By probing species' origins and adaptations, he redefined humanity's place in nature, imbuing the study of life with a sense of evolutionary continuity that continues to guide modern research and thought.
