For this step you will need a large biomass of cells in order to be able to extract a useful quantity of genetic materia. The ideal way to obtain large quantities of cells, is by y Lysogeny broth culture. This culture can be used for DNA extraction, here we will be using ENZA Plasmid DNA Mini Kit I by Omega Bio-Tek.

Since a kit will be used for this process it is rather straight forward. But one should still understand the basic concepts invovled.

What we will be doing is placing our cells in a buffer which contains RNAse enzymes to eliminate our unwanted material. The cells are then lysed and the DNA along with all other cell contents are freed into the liquid.

Afterwards we precipate the unwanted proteins and lipids and seperate the DNA from them by pipetting off the surnatant. The precipitate is thrown away. The surnatant is plassed through a filter (mini chromatography column) onto which the DNA binds. The DNA is then be eluted by use of an elutative solution. This is where we recover our DNA sequences.

Here is a more detailed protocol for this process:

1. Pipette off 5 mL of LB culture into an appropriately sized tube.
1. Centrifuge the cultures at 16 000 g for 10 mins (Remember to balance the centrifuge).
1. Remove the supernatant, you can safely tap the tube on a paper towel to thoroughly remove any liquid medium.
1. Add 250 &mu;L of RNAse A solution and vortex/pipette up and down to resuspend the cells.
1. Transfer the suspension into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
1. Add 250 &mu;L of solution two, rotate the tube to gently mix the liquids. This will yield a clear lysate. Incubate for 2-3 mins at room temperature.
    - Note: Avoid vigorous mixing as this will shear chromosomal DNA and lower plasmid purity.
1. Add 350 &mu;L of solution 3 and invert immediately until a flocculent white precipitate has formed.
    - Mix instantly after adding solution 3 to avoid heterogeneous precipitation.
1. Centrifuge at maximum speed (13 000 g) for 10 mins. The compact white pellet which has formed is the cellular debris.
1. Transfer the supernatant into a DNA mini chromatography column with the appropriate collection tube.
    - Careful not to aspirate cellular debris.
1. Centrifuge at maximum speed (13 000 g) for 1 min.
1. Discard the filtrate that was collected in the collection tube.
    - Note that the DNA is currently bound to the column's filter.
1. Add 500 &mu;L HBC buffer.
    - The buffer should have been diluted with isopropanol before use.
1. Centrifuge at maximum speed (13 000 g) for 1 min.
1. Discard the filtrate.
1. Add 700 &mu;L DNA wash buffer.
    - The buffer should have been diluted with 100% ethanol before use.
1. Centrifuge at maximum speed (13 000 g) for 1 min.
1. Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.
1. Centrifuge the empty column at maximum speed (13 000 g) for 1 min in order to dry the column. This step is important so as not to obtain an eluate contaminated with ethanol.
1. Transfer the column into a 1.5 mL tube and add 30-100 &mu;L of elution buffer.
1. Let incubate at room temperature for 1 min.
1. Centrifuge at maximum speed (13 000 g) for 1 min, the elution buffer will detach the DNA and it will be collected in our eppendorf tube.
1. Store the DNA solution at -20&deg;C.

After obtaining this DNA solution one can proceed with downstream applications. Some possible applications are a verification PCR coupled with a verification electropheretic gel. This would allow us to visualise the presence of a specific sequence of DNA in our cells.

A simple electropheretic gel would allow us to visualise all contents present in the cell. If the DNA has not been sheared then it should show a couple of bands, minimum 1 for the chromosomal DNA and possibly a couple more which represent plasmid DNA.
