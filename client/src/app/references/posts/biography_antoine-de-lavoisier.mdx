## Life

Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier was born in Paris on 26 August 1743. His family were part of the French nobility and were relatively well off. Tragically, he lost his parents at the age of five, becoming an orphan. His inheritance, however, assured him a solid education. Lavoisier attended le Collège des Quatre-Nations in Paris, where he was introduced to chemistry, botany, astronomy, and mathematics.

Afterwards, Lavoisier went on to study at la Faculté de droit civil et canonique, receiving his baccalauréat in law two years later. Although he had qualified as an attorney, he never practised law. Instead, he pursued his growing passion for science, which had intensified during law school, where he frequently attended scientific conferences. Lavoisier became an avid reader of the Dictionnaire de la Chymie published by Pierre Macquer and wrote his first scientific paper, on the hydration of gypsum, in 1764. He presented this paper to the Académie des Sciences.

On 16 December 1771, Lavoisier married Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze, who was just 13 years old at the time. She was the daughter of a fellow member of la Ferme Générale. Marie-Anne soon became an invaluable collaborator to Lavoisier, translating many scientific writings from English to French, as well as making sketches and engravings of laboratory instruments. Together, they hosted soirées attended by prominent men of science, where discussions on chemistry and other topics flourished.

Despite his successes, Lavoisier became a victim of the Reign of Terror. He lost his government post during the French Revolution and was ostracised by the new government and society. Revolutionaries sought to erase any memory of the old regime, to which Lavoisier belonged as a prominent member of the nobility.

Public sentiment turned against Lavoisier in no small part due to Jean-Paul Marat, who became his staunch enemy. Born poor, Marat worked his way into the scientific community, eventually becoming a physician. At one point, he sought membership in the Académie des Sciences, claiming he had uncovered the concept of *magnétisme animal* ("animal magnetism"), the belief in a supernatural energy permeating living beings and matter. Marat claimed he could see this "igneous energy" emerging from heated rocks. He was ridiculed by the Academy—Lavoisier being especially vocal in dismissing *magnétisme animal* as "a product of pure imagination."

Upon gaining influence during the Revolution, Marat focused his energies on discrediting Lavoisier, writing pamphlets denouncing his science, aristocratic background, and character. Although Marat was ultimately killed by Charlotte Corday—becoming a martyr in the eyes of his supporters—Lavoisier was later branded a traitor for his connections to the previous regime and his support of foreign scientists. During his trial, a judge famously declared:

<Blockquote src="Judge at Lavoisier's tribunal">
    La République n'a pas besoin de savants ni de chimistes; le cours de la justice ne peut être suspendu.
    <br />
    The Republic has no need of scientists or chemists; the course of justice cannot be delayed.

Officially, Lavoisier's execution was based on his aristocratic status and involvement in the old regime. He was guillotined at the Place de la Concorde in Paris on 8 May 1794, at the age of 50. One year later, he was posthumously pardoned, and the French government acknowledged having wrongly executed one of its most brilliant scientists. Marie-Anne received a short note and the remaining affairs of her late husband.

Among his many achievements, Lavoisier also contributed to the creation and development of the metric system. His careful experiments measuring weight proved pivotal to his scientific progress, particularly his realisation that the total mass in a closed system remains constant before and after a chemical reaction. In 1772, he and his colleagues famously purchased a diamond, sealed it in a glass jar, and directed an enormous magnifying glass onto it until it burned. The diamond disappeared, leaving only smoke in the jar, yet the jar's overall weight remained unchanged—this demonstrated what is now known as the law of conservation of mass.

He is often paraphrased as saying: "Nothing is lost, everything transforms," a reference to the concept that mass is neither created nor destroyed.

<Blockquote src="Traité élémentaire de chimie Tome premier - Lavoisier (Fermentation vineuses - Page 140-141)">
    On voit que pour arriver à la solution de ces deux questions, il falloit d'abord bien connoître l'analyse & la nature du corps susceptible de fermenter, & les produits de la fermentation ; car rien ne se crée, ni dans les opérations de l'art, ni dans celles de la nature, & l'on peut poser en principes que dans toute opération, il y a une égale quantité de matière avant & après l'opération ; que la qualité & la quantité des principes est la même, qu'il n'y a que des changemens, des modifications.[^1]

In subsequent experiments, Lavoisier noticed that burning charcoal or diamonds produced the same gas,[^2] leading him to conclude that charcoal and diamonds were the same element, simply existing in different forms. Also in 1772, he began studying combustion in earnest, reproducing several of Joseph Black's famed experiments. This line of investigation culminated in Lavoisier's discovery of oxygen's role in combustion. By 1778, he had discovered and named oxygen, and in 1783 he identified hydrogen. He also characterised the composition of the air we breathe and drew a link between respiration and combustion.

Lavoisier's most significant contribution to science came with his *Traité Élémentaire de la Chimie*, published in 1789. In it, he proposed a standard system of chemical nomenclature—the foundation of the nomenclature we still use today—and provided a comprehensive picture of chemistry, including the first concise definition of the conservation of mass. This publication is regarded as marking the start of stoichiometry as a formal discipline and is widely hailed as the first modern chemistry textbook.

He achieved so much that it's easy to lose track. Below is just a short list of additional feats and accomplishments by Lavoisier:

- Predicted the existence of silicon in 1787, almost a century before Dmitri Mendeleev published his modern periodic table of elements.
- Demonstrated in 1777 that sulphur was an element rather than a compound.
- Collaborated on one of France's earliest geological maps.
- Showed that substances can transition among liquid, gas, and solid states without altering their mass or chemical composition.
- Improved the quality of gunpowder for the French army, which was adopted in 1775.
- Received a gold medal from the king of France for his work on lighting public buildings.

## Key Discoveries and Their Scientific Underpinnings

### 1. The Law of Conservation of Mass

Lavoisier's meticulous experiments established that the total mass of a closed system remains the same before and after a chemical reaction. In modern notation, we write:

$$
\sum m_{\text{reactants}} \;=\; \sum m_{\text{products}}.
$$

He demonstrated this principle by burning substances in sealed containers (such as diamonds in a glass jar) and showing that any apparent "loss" of matter was accounted for by products such as gases or ash. This overturned older notions that something was "lost" during combustion.

### 2. Stoichiometry and Quantitative Analysis

In his *Traité Élémentaire de la Chimie*, Lavoisier emphasised precise measurement of reactants and products. This quantitative approach is the foundation of stoichiometry. For instance, a generic combustion reaction might be:

$$
\mathrm{C}_x\mathrm{H}_y + \; O_2 \;\longrightarrow\; x\,CO_2 + \frac{y}{2}\,H_2O,
$$

illustrating that the moles (and hence masses) of each substance involved must balance. Such balanced equations are the backbone of modern chemical analysis.

### 3. Discovery of Oxygen and the Overthrow of Phlogiston Theory

One of Lavoisier's greatest achievements was identifying and naming oxygen ($O_2$). Before his work, most European chemists embraced the phlogiston theory, which posited an invisible "fire element" released during combustion. Lavoisier's experiments, however, showed that combustion required a gas he later named "oxygen" (from the Greek roots for "acid-former").

- **Oxygen in combustion**:  
  $$ \text{Fuel} + O_2 \;\longrightarrow\; \text{Oxidised products (e.g. } CO_2, H_2O\text{)} $$

- **Respiration**: He also recognised parallels between combustion and respiration, noting that breathing consumes oxygen and releases carbon dioxide.

### 4. Identification of Hydrogen and Water's Composition

In addition to oxygen, Lavoisier was instrumental in identifying hydrogen ($H_2$). He and contemporaries found that water could be split into hydrogen and oxygen, disproving the old idea that water was an indivisible "element."

- **Formation of water**:  
  $$ 2H_2 + O_2 \;\longrightarrow\; 2H_2O. $$

This discovery laid the groundwork for understanding water's composition and chemical bonding.

### 5. Standardised Chemical Nomenclature

Prior to Lavoisier, chemical substances were described with a haphazard assortment of names. In his textbook, he introduced a systematic naming system such as calling "dephlogisticated air" by the name *oxygen*—that endures in modern form. This clarity was vital to international collaboration and further advancements in chemistry.

### 6. Early Metric System Contributions

Lavoisier's passion for precise measurement naturally extended to standardised units. He and other French scientists promoted what would become the metric system, ensuring consistent methods of measuring length, mass, and volume. This cross-disciplinary effort streamlined scientific inquiry and engineering.

## Legacy

Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier is often called the "father of modern chemistry." By emphasising careful measurement and quantitative experiments, he established standards for scientific methodology that still underpin modern chemical research. His pioneering work on combustion and the identification of oxygen helped overturn centuries of misconceptions about how substances burn, while his experiments on mass conservation laid the groundwork for much of modern science. Lavoisier's *Traité Élémentaire de la Chimie* introduced a rational nomenclature that continues to guide chemists today. Despite his tragic end during the Revolution, his intellectual legacy endures, influencing generations of scientists worldwide.
