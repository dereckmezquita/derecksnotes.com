Niels Henrik David Bohr (1885-1962) was a Danish physicist whose pioneering work on atomic structure and quantum theory transformed modern physics. Through his innovative atomic model and contributions to quantum mechanics, Bohr laid much of the groundwork for how we understand electrons, energy levels, and the complex behaviour of matter at the smallest scales.

## Early Life and Education

Bohr was born on 7 October 1885 in Copenhagen, Denmark. His father, Christian Bohr, was a physiology professor, and his mother, Ellen Adler Bohr, was part of a prominent Danish Jewish family. From an early age, Bohr demonstrated remarkable aptitude in both mathematics and science. After attending Gammelholm Latin School, he enrolled at the University of Copenhagen, where he studied physics and immersed himself in cutting-edge research topics.

Bohr's doctoral thesis at the University of Copenhagen (completed in 1911) investigated the electron theory of metals, reflecting his interest in merging classical ideas with new discoveries about atomic phenomena. Seeking to expand his knowledge, Bohr moved to Manchester to work under Ernest Rutherford, who had recently established the nucleus-centred model of the atom.

## Path to the Bohr Model

Rutherford's nuclear model proposed that most of an atom's mass resides in a small, positively charged nucleus, around which electrons orbit. However, classical electromagnetic theory suggested that orbiting electrons should continuously emit radiation (losing energy) and spiral into the nucleus. This conundrum prompted Bohr to apply recent quantum insights particularly those from Max Planck and Albert Einstein to stabilise the atom theoretically.

### Key Postulates of the Bohr Model

1. **Quantised Orbits**  
   Bohr assumed that electrons travel only in specific orbits (or energy levels) at certain allowable radii from the nucleus. In these orbits, electrons do not emit electromagnetic radiation, thus avoiding the classical 'death spiral'.  

2. **Energy Level Transitions**  
   Electrons may jump between these quantised orbits by absorbing or emitting a photon of energy equal to the difference in energy between the initial and final orbit:
   $$
   \Delta E \;=\; E_\text{final} - E_\text{initial}
   \;=\;
   h \, \nu,
   $$
   where $ h $ is Planck's constant and $ \nu $ is the frequency of the emitted or absorbed photon.

3. **Angular Momentum Quantisation**  
   Bohr proposed that an electron's orbital angular momentum must be an integer multiple of $ \hbar = \tfrac{h}{2\pi} $:
   $$
   m_e \, v_n \, r_n
   \;=\;
   n\,\hbar,
   $$
   with $ m_e $ the electron mass, $ v_n $ the velocity of the electron in the $ n $-th orbit, $ r_n $ the orbit radius, and $ n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots $

## Demonstration: Energy Levels in the Hydrogen Atom

A hallmark of Bohr's model is its success in describing the hydrogen atom's spectral lines. Let's show a mathematical derivation of the energy levels.

### 1. Quantised Orbits and Coulomb Attraction

In the hydrogen atom, the nucleus is a single proton of charge $ +e $, and the electron has charge $ -e $. The electrostatic (Coulomb) attraction keeps the electron in orbit around the proton. Classically, the centripetal force requirement states:

$$
\frac{m_e v^2}{r}
\;=\;
\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\frac{e^2}{r^2},
$$

so

$$
m_e v^2
\;=\;
\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\frac{e^2}{r}.
$$

### 2. Angular Momentum Quantisation

Bohr's angular momentum postulate stipulates:

$$
m_e v\,r \;=\; n \hbar, \quad n = 1, 2, 3, \dots
$$

From this, we can solve for $ v $ in terms of $ n $:

$$
v
\;=\;
\frac{n\,\hbar}{m_e \, r}.
$$

### 3. Determining the Orbit Radius

We combine the two expressions for $ v $. From Coulomb's law:

$$
m_e\,\Bigl(\frac{n\,\hbar}{m_e\,r}\Bigr)^2
\;=\;
\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\frac{e^2}{r},
$$

which simplifies to

$$
\frac{n^2\,\hbar^2}{m_e\,r^2}
\;=\;
\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\frac{e^2}{r}.
$$

Rearranging, we find

$$
r_n
\;=\;
\frac{4\pi\epsilon_0\,\hbar^2}{m_e\,e^2}
\,n^2.
$$

When $ n=1 $, the radius $ r_1 $ is known as the Bohr radius $ (a_0)\approx 0.529\, \text{\AA} $. This formula shows that the radius of the $ n $-th orbit scales like $ n^2 $.

### 4. Energy of the Electron in the $ n $-th Orbit

The electron's total energy $ E_n $ is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies. We use:

- **Kinetic Energy**:  
  $$
  K
  \;=\;
  \tfrac{1}{2}\,m_e\,v^2,
  $$
- **Potential Energy**:  
  $$
  U
  \;=\;
  -\,\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\frac{e^2}{r}.
  $$

With $ v^2 = \tfrac{e^2}{2\pi\epsilon_0\,r\,m_e} $ from above, or equivalently from combining steps, a more direct route yields a well-known result:

$$
E_n
\;=\;
-\,
\frac{m_e\,e^4}{8\,\epsilon_0^2\,h^2}
\,
\frac{1}{n^2}
\;=\;
-\,\frac{13.6\,\text{eV}}{n^2},
$$

where 13.6 eV is the ground-state energy magnitude for hydrogen. This formula quantifies the discrete energy levels that the electron can occupy, matching the Balmer, Lyman, and other emission spectra series famously observed in hydrogen discharge tubes.

## Impact on Quantum Theory

Bohr's atomic model represented an intermediary step between classical physics and full quantum mechanics. Though eventually superseded by more complete quantum treatments (Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and Schrödinger's wave mechanics), Bohr's postulates introduced crucial ideas: quantisation of observables, discrete energy spectra, and the importance of Planck's constant $ h $.

Bohr's concept of 'complementarity' the notion that atomic phenomena must sometimes be described in terms of wave-like properties and sometimes in terms of particle like properties would go on to shape the philosophical and conceptual landscape of quantum mechanics. This outlook emphasised how measurement constraints produce apparently contradictory outcomes, yet both facets are needed for a complete picture.

## Professional Life and Collaborations

After publishing his model in 1913, Bohr returned to Denmark, where he founded the Institute of Theoretical Physics (later named the Niels Bohr Institute) in 1921. It quickly became a centre for cutting-edge quantum research, attracting distinguished scientists like Werner Heisenberg and Wolfgang Pauli, and hosting visiting scholars such as Erwin Schrödinger. Bohr served as a mentor and collaborator, fostering a creative and supportive environment that furthered the rapid development of quantum mechanics in the 1920s and 1930s.

### World War II and Beyond

When Denmark fell under Nazi occupation, Bohr used his prominence to assist Jewish colleagues and eventually fled to Sweden in 1943. He continued to contribute scientifically, providing insights into nuclear fission and later travelling to the United States to join the Manhattan Project in a consultancy role, advocating for international cooperation in nuclear energy post-war.

## Key Works and Publications

1. **On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules (1913)**  
   Bohr's seminal series of papers laying out the quantised orbital model for the hydrogen atom. This work earned him the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physics.

2. **Atomic Theory and the Description of Nature (1934)**  
   A collection of essays that introduced Bohr's philosophical approach to quantum phenomena and complementarity.

3. **Open Letters and Advocacy**  
   In the aftermath of WWII, Bohr wrote open letters promoting peaceful international collaboration on nuclear matters, reflecting his staunch commitment to science serving humanity rather than destructive ends.

## Lasting Influence and Legacy

Niels Bohr died on 18 November 1962 in Copenhagen, yet his influence pervades modern physics. His early atomic model, though a transitional theory, still provides an entry point for understanding quantum transitions, spectroscopic data, and the essential principle that fundamental quantities in nature can be discrete rather than continuous.

The Niels Bohr Institute continues as a premier scientific hub, commemorating Bohr's legacy of open dialogue, bold ideas, and unwavering pursuit of knowledge. Generations of physicists regard his work as foundational to quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, and the very philosophy of science itself.

## Extras

<Blockquote src="Niels Bohr, 'Atomic Theory and the Description of Nature'">
We must be clear that, when it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images and establishing mental connections.

Niels Bohr's deep blend of mathematical insight and physical intuition opened unprecedented vistas in atomic theory. By recognising the quantum nature of electron orbits and energy levels, he provided one of the earliest bridges between the comfortable rules of classical physics and the surprising, often counterintuitive laws of quantum mechanics a leap that continues to define modern science.
