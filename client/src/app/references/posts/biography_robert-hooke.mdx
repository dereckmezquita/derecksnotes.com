An unfortunate side effect of Hooke's rivalry with Newton seems to be a lack of portraits of the scientist. Here is a microscope very much like the one he could have used.

## Life

Robert Hooke was a scientist, polymath, renaissance man, and influential figure of the Royal Society in London. His works range from astronomy and physics to biology. He was born in Freshwater, England on the Isle of Wight in 1635, the last of four children born to John Hooke, a priest at the Freshwater Parish, and Cecily Hyles.

He was educated at Wadham College, University of Oxford, and spent his career at the Royal Society and Gresham College. Robert Hooke is particularly important for his experimentation. He was at one point an assistant to Thomas Willis and Robert Boyle. During his time with John Wilkins, the Invisible College was formed, which would later become the Royal Society. Hooke subsequently became a member of the council of the Royal Society, Gresham Professor of Geometry (a position at Gresham College giving free educational lectures to the public), and Surveyor of the City of London after the Great Fire of London.

He was an important architect of the time and was responsible for many buildings erected after the Great Fire, many of which are unfortunately misattributed today, as well as for a set of planning controls for the City of London that remain visible today.

Robert Hooke famously maintained a rivalry with Isaac Newton. Hooke claimed that Isaac Newton's "Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica" was inspired by his work and even insinuated that some parts were copied from him. This did not sit well with Newton and sparked a lifelong feud between the two great scientists. It is suspected that Newton, as president of the Royal Society, may have "misplaced" some of Hooke's important works and, famously, his portraits. No authentic portraits of Hooke survive, and no one knows his exact appearance. All that remains are a few descriptions of him by contemporaries.

## Works

Robert Hooke is famous in science and biology for his publication *Micrographia* (1665)[^1]. In this revolutionary work, he used a microscope to study the structure, composition, and behavior of many everyday substances and objects: snow, fleas, ticks, hair, and even urine. Such a detailed study had never been done before and was transformative for science. He was the first to name "cells" when he noticed that the spaces in cork resembled the small rooms (cells) used by monks. Hooke also peer-reviewed some of Leeuwenhoek's work, which demonstrated the existence of what we now recognize as bacteria and protozoa.

Here are some excerpts from *Micrographia*[^1]:

Hooke also made many improvements to the microscope, inventing ways to control its height and angle, as well as mechanisms for illumination. Hooke's microscopes were capable of around 50x magnification, which was impressive at the time.

Many of Hooke's publications are beautifully illustrated, reflecting his keen talent for accurately depicting his observations. Hooke was truly a polymath, gifted in mathematics, physics, and art.

## Key Discoveries and Impact

1. **Hooke's Law**  
   Hooke's most famous contribution to physics is Hooke's Law, which states that the force needed to stretch (or compress) a spring is proportional to the distance it is stretched (or compressed):
   $$
   F = -kx
   $$
   where $k$ is the spring constant, $x$ is the displacement, and the negative sign denotes the restoring direction of the force. This fundamental principle underpins modern elasticity theory and has applications in mechanical engineering and materials science.

2. **Architectural Work and Urban Planning**  
   As Surveyor of the City of London after the Great Fire of 1666, Hooke was instrumental in rebuilding large sections of the city. He introduced orderly street plans and helped restore essential structures. Although many projects are attributed solely to Christopher Wren, historians acknowledge that Hooke was deeply involved and sometimes unfairly overshadowed.

3. **Astronomical Insights**  
   Hooke engaged in various astronomical observations, including work on planetary motions and star parallax. He designed and improved telescopes, although he is best remembered for his microscope achievements.

4. **Influence on Newtonian Science**  
   Despite his rivalry with Isaac Newton, Hooke's ideas spurred deeper investigations into gravitational theory, planetary motion, and optics. His discussions and disputes with Newton, while contentious, pushed both scientists to refine their theories.

5. **Scientific Method and Experimental Approach**  
   Hooke's meticulous experimentation and emphasis on direct observation significantly influenced the Royal Society's culture of inquiry. He championed empiricism, insisting that experiments and precise measurement underlie scientific progress.

## The Royal Society Archives

If you have the honor of visiting the Royal Society Archives, you may have the opportunity to see some of Robert Hooke's works firsthand. I had some fun with a first edition of *Micrographia*[^1], and here are some of its most famous images:
