Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a theoretical physicist whose work radically changed our understanding of space, time, and energy. Born in Ulm, in what is now Germany, he reinvented modern physics through his theories of relativity and his insights into the quantum nature of light. By the early 20th century, Einstein's approach to physical phenomena placed him among the most influential scientists in history.

## Early Life and Education

Einstein was born on 14 March 1879 to a secular Jewish family. His father, Hermann, ran an electrochemical business, and his mother, Pauline, cultivated his interest in music and culture. From an early age, Einstein demonstrated a strong curiosity for geometry and natural phenomena, though he sometimes clashed with conventional teaching methods. After moving to Italy with his family, he completed his secondary education in Aarau, Switzerland.

In 1896, he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School (ETH) in Zurich, studying physics and mathematics. Whilst he occasionally struggled with strict academic rules, he found inspiration in the work of scientists such as James Clerk Maxwell, whose equations unified electricity, magnetism, and optics.

## Path to Revolutionary Ideas

Despite graduating from ETH, Einstein initially failed to secure a stable academic position. In 1902, he began working at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern, reviewing patent submissions. During his free time, he tackled problems in theoretical physics, sharing ideas with like-minded friends who were similarly fascinated by the fundamental laws of nature.

In 1905, Einstein's famous 'annus mirabilis' produced four groundbreaking papers:

1. **Photoelectric Effect**  
   He proposed that light behaves as packets of energy (photons), explaining why electrons are emitted from metals only when the light exceeds a particular frequency. This work laid the foundations of quantum mechanics and earned him the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics.

2. **Brownian Motion**  
   He accounted for the random motion of tiny particles in a fluid, offering observable proof of atoms and molecules. This reinforced the statistical approach to matter and highlighted the reality of microscopic structures.

3. **Special Relativity**  
   He showed that space and time form a unified continuum, and that measurements of distance and duration depend on the observer's motion. This theory supplanted the notion of absolute space and time, introducing the (popular) equation:
   $$
   E = mc^2.
   $$

4. **Mass-Energy Equivalence**  
   In a shorter companion paper, Einstein elaborated on the deeper relationship between mass and energy. Whilst $ E = mc^2 $ is well known, the more complete formula for a particle's total energy is:
   $$
   E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2,
   $$
   where $ p $ is momentum. For $ p = 0 $, this reduces to $ E = mc^2 $, indicating that mass can be viewed as a highly concentrated form of energy.

## Deep Dive: Demonstrating $E = mc^2$

One of Einstein's enduring contributions is the equivalence of mass and energy. Below is a more extensive explanation using principles of special relativity. Following the initial conceptual steps, we will add a final 'hardcore mathematics' section for readers who wish to see the derivation in a fully rigorous way.

### 1. Total Energy of a Particle

In special relativity, the total energy $ E $ of a particle of mass $ m $ and momentum $ p $ is:

$$
E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2.
$$

If the particle is at rest ($ p = 0 $), then this expression simplifies to:

$$
E = mc^2.
$$

### 2. Momentum Conservation Argument

Consider a box of mass $ M $ in free space:

- The box emits two photons in opposite directions, each with energy $ E_\gamma $.  
- Because photons possess momentum $ p_\gamma = \tfrac{E_\gamma}{c} $, the net momentum of the two photons is zero (they travel in opposite directions).  
- The box recoils slightly to keep the total momentum of the system zero.

Before emission, the box has mass $ M $. After emission, careful bookkeeping shows that the box's mass decreases by

$$
\Delta m = \frac{E_\gamma}{c^2}.
$$

This indicates that the energy carried away by the photons corresponds to a loss of mass. When mass is converted into energy (or vice versa), the factor $ c^2 $ governs this transformation, revealing the power of the mass-energy relation.

### 3. Four-Momentum Derivation

For a more formal approach, one can use four-vectors in Minkowski spacetime:

- The energy-momentum 4-vector of a particle is $ \bigl(\tfrac{E}{c}, \vec{p}\bigr) $.  
- The invariant magnitude (norm) of this 4-vector is
  $$
  \frac{E^2}{c^2} \;-\; p^2 c^2 \;=\; (mc^2)^2.
  $$
- At rest, where $ p=0 $, the relationship reduces to
  $$
  E = mc^2.
  $$

Whether approached via momentum conservation or the geometry of spacetime, the conclusion is identical: mass and energy are fundamentally intertwined and can be transformed into one another under relativistic conditions.

### 4. Mathematical Derivation

For those desiring a more advanced demonstration, let us construct $E = mc^2$ step by step using relativistic dynamics. We will work in one spatial dimension for simplicity, though the argument generalises easily.

1. **Relativistic Lagrangian**

   A free particle of rest mass $m$ in special relativity can be described by the Lagrangian

   $$
   \mathcal{L} \;=\; -\,m\,c^2 \,\sqrt{1 \;-\; \frac{v^2}{c^2}},
   $$

   where $v$ is the particle's velocity. The canonical momentum $p$ is defined by

   $$
   p \;=\; \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial v}
   \;=\; \frac{m\,v}{\sqrt{1 \;-\; \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.
   $$

   We can also define the Lorentz factor as $\gamma \equiv \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \tfrac{v^2}{c^2}}}$, giving $p = \gamma m \, v$.

2. **Hamiltonian and Total Energy**

   The Hamiltonian $H$ represents the total energy. We obtain $H$ from the Legendre transform:

   $$
   H \;=\; p \,v \;-\; \mathcal{L}.
   $$

   Substituting $p = \gamma m \, v$ and the Lagrangian, we get

   $$
   H \;=\; \gamma m \, v^2 \;+\; m\,c^2\,\sqrt{1 \;-\; \frac{v^2}{c^2}}.
   $$

   After simplifying (using algebraic manipulations involving $\gamma$), one finds

   $$
   H \;=\; \gamma\,m\,c^2
   \;=\;
   \frac{m\,c^2}{\sqrt{1 \;-\; \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.
   $$

3. **Energy-Momentum Relation**

   From the definition of $\gamma$, we can introduce momentum $p = \gamma m\,v$ and note that

   $$
   \gamma^2 \;=\; 1 \;+\; \frac{p^2}{m^2\,c^2}.
   $$

   Thus,

   $$
   H \;=\; \gamma\,m\,c^2
   \;=\; m\,c^2 \,\sqrt{1 + \frac{p^2}{m^2\,c^2}}
   \;=\; \sqrt{(mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2}.
   $$

   In the rest frame ($p=0$), $H = mc^2$, which is the particle's internal energy. Interpreting $H$ as the total energy $E$ leads directly to:

   $$
   E \;=\; \sqrt{(mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2}.
   $$

4. **Rest Case: The Iconic Equation**

   In the specific case $p = 0$, this result collapses to

   $$
   E \;=\; mc^2,
   $$

   providing the enduring mass-energy equivalence. Hence, the 'rest energy' of a particle is given purely by its rest mass times $c^2$.

Putting it all together:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{(1) Lagrangian approach reveals } p = \gamma m v. \\
&\text{(2) Hamiltonian transform gives } H = \gamma m c^2. \\
&\text{(3) Identify } E \equiv H \text{ so } E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2.\\
&\text{(4) Rest condition }(p=0)\text{ yields } E = mc^2.
\end{aligned}
$$

This unification of the Newtonian limit ($v \ll c$) with relativistic kinematics underscores how mass is not just a measure of inertia, but also a quantification of intrinsic energy. 

## Academic Career and General Relativity

Einstein's success in 1905 earned him increasing respect among physicists. He held positions at universities in Bern, Prague, and Zurich before moving to Berlin in 1914 to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences. Between 1907 and 1915, he reinterpreted gravity not as a Newtonian force but as a manifestation of spacetime curvature.

### General Relativity

In 1915, Einstein presented his general theory of relativity, positing that mass-energy curves spacetime. This framework accounted for phenomena such as the bending of light near the Sun, famously observed by Arthur Eddington during a solar eclipse in 1919. General relativity also explained anomalies in Mercury's orbit and laid the groundwork for modern cosmology, including black holes and the notion of an expanding universe.

#### Einstein's Field Equations

Represented succinctly:

$$
G_{\mu \nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu \nu},
$$

where:
- $ G_{\mu \nu} $ is the Einstein curvature tensor describing spacetime curvature,
- $ \Lambda $ is the cosmological constant,
- $ g_{\mu \nu} $ is the metric tensor specifying the geometry of spacetime,
- $ T_{\mu \nu} $ is the stress-energy tensor,
- $ G $ is the gravitational constant,
- $ c $ is the speed of light.

These field equations revolutionised how we understand gravitational phenomena, unifying geometry with physical content in a single elegant system.

## Personal Life

Einstein was as notable for his complicated personal life as he was for his scientific acumen. His first marriage, to Mileva Marić, grew strained over the years. He later married his cousin, Elsa Einstein, in 1919. He was reputed to have had various close relationships and correspondences whilst teaching at universities. Though the historical record can be incomplete, these anecdotes add nuance to the image of a genial, witty intellectual who captured the public imagination.
