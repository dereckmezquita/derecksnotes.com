<a id="alkali_metal">Alkali Metal</a> - Any of the elements in **Group 1** of the periodic table (e.g. Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr). They are characterised by:
- Having a single electron in their outermost shell
- Exhibiting high reactivity, especially with water
- Forming strong bases (alkaline solutions) upon reaction with water

**Example reaction**: Sodium reacting with water:

$$
2\,\text{Na} + 2\,\text{H}_2\text{O} \;\to\; 2\,\text{NaOH} + \text{H}_2\uparrow
$$

Because of their reactivity, [alkali metals](#alkali_metal) are typically stored under oil. They share similarities yet are distinct from the [alkaline-earth-metal](#alkaline_earth_metal) group next door.
