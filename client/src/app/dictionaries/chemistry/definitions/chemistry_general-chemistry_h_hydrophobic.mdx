<a id="hydrophobic">Hydrophobic</a> - Describes a **substance** or **functional group** that **repels** or does **not mix** well with **water**. Typically non-polar or low in polarity, lacking hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.

- Examples: Alkyl chains, many hydrocarbons, oils.
- Relationship with [hydrophilic](#hydrophilic) components leads to micelle or bilayer formation, or to separate phases like an [emulsion](#emulsion).
- Thermodynamically, water molecules reorganise around hydrophobic moieties, reducing [entropy](#entropy) unless aggregation occurs (hydrophobic effect).
- Changes to solution composition can also modify certain [colligative_properties](#colligative_properties).
