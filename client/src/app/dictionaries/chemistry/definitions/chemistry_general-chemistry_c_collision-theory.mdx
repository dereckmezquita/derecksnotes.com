<a id="collision_theory">Collision Theory</a> - Proposes that **molecules** must **collide** with **sufficient energy** (at least [activation_energy](#activation_energy)) and **proper orientation** to form products.

- Rate ~ collision frequency $\times$ fraction of collisions with $E \ge E_\mathrm{a}$.  
- Temperature increase (see [charles_law](#charles_law)) boosts molecular speeds, raising collision frequency and success fraction.
- A [catalyst](#catalyst) lowers $E_\mathrm{a}$, boosting reaction rate.
- At [chemical_equilibrium](#chemical_equilibrium), forward and reverse collisions occur at the same rate.
