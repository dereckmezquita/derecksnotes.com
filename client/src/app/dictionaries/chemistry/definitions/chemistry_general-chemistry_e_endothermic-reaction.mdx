<a id="endothermic_reaction">Endothermic Reaction</a> - A reaction that **absorbs heat** from its surroundings. It exhibits a positive enthalpy ($\Delta H > 0$), meaning the system's [enthalpy](#enthalpy) increases.

- Observed through drop in external temperature or direct measurement via [calorimetry](#calorimetry).
- Requires sufficient energy input for bond-breaking, consistent with [collision_theory](#collision_theory).
- Entropy changes ([entropy](#entropy)) may also drive the reaction if the system becomes more disordered, compensating for energy absorption.
