<a id="polymer">Polymer</a> - Macromolecule composed of many repeating [monomer](#monomer) units joined by covalent bonds.

Types:
- Addition (chain-growth)
- Condensation (step-growth)
- Natural (proteins, cellulose)
- Synthetic (PVC, nylon)

Key properties:
- Degree of [polymerisation](#polymerisation)
- [molecular_mass](#molecular_mass) distribution
- [cross_linking](#cross_linking) extent
- Crystallinity percentage

Common structures:
- Linear (PE)
- Branched (LDPE)
- Network (phenol-formaldehyde)
