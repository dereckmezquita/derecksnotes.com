<a id="jar_test">Jar Test</a> - A **simple lab procedure** used in **water treatment** to determine the **optimal dose** of **coagulants** or flocculants. Involves mixing multiple water samples with varying coagulant [concentration](#concentration), stirring, and allowing solids to settle.

- Observes floc formation and clarifies which dosage yields the clearest supernatant.  
- Ties into [decantation](#decantation) to separate out settled flocs.  
- Physical-chemical context: [collision_theory](#collision_theory) for particle aggregation and potential [emulsion](#emulsion) breaking if oils are present.

<Alert type='note'>
Jar tests guide large-scale water treatment plants, minimising chemical usage while ensuring turbidity and contaminant reduction.
