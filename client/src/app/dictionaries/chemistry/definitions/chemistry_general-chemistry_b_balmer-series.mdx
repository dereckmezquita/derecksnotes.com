<a id="balmer_series">Balmer Series</a> - A set of **visible** **spectral lines** corresponding to **electronic transitions** in hydrogen that end at the **n=2** energy level. Each line in the series is given by the Rydberg formula:

$$
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_\mathrm{H}\left(\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{n^2}\right)\quad (n>2)
$$

- Explains distinct colours in hydrogen's emission spectrum, historically key to the [bohr_model](#bohr_model).
- Photon [frequency](#frequency) or wavelength can be converted to energy (in joules) and scaled by [avogadro_constant](#avogadro_constant) to relate to mole-based energies.
- Ties conceptually to [binding_energy](#binding_energy) for the electron in hydrogen, though the electron is never fully removed in these transitions.

<Alert type='note'>
The Balmer Series underpins atomic theory, revealing discrete energy levels in hydrogen and forming a stepping stone to modern quantum mechanics.
