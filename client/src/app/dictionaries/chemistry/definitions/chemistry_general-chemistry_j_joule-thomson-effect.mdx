<a id="joule_thomson_effect">Joule-Thomson Effect</a> - The **temperature change** observed in a **real gas** when it **expands** (or is compressed) **adiabatically** through a **porous plug** or **throttle**, with no external work done. 

- If the intermolecular forces are significant, the gas cools (or warms) upon expansion, deviating from [ideal_gas](#ideal_gas) behaviour.
- Ties to [enthalpy](#enthalpy): The process is typically run at constant enthalpy (an **isenthalpic** expansion).
- [heat_capacity](#heat_capacity) affects the magnitude of cooling or heating.
- Influences refrigeration cycles, where controlled expansions liquefy gases. Also complements standard [gas_law](#gas_law) concepts.
