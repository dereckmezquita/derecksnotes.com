<a id="ebulioscopy">Ebulioscopy</a> - A **technique** used to **determine** the **molecular mass** of a solute by measuring the **boiling-point** elevation of a solution. It relies on [colligative_properties](#colligative_properties), where the temperature increase depends on how many particles are dissolved rather than their chemical nature.

This method involves comparing the solvent's normal boiling temperature with that of the solution, then relating the difference ($\Delta T_b$) to the solute's molality. The solvent-specific proportionality constant is called the ebullioscopic constant $K_b$, tying in with [enthalpy](#enthalpy) considerations of phase transitions.

$$
\Delta T_b = K_b \times m \times i
$$

- $K_b$: Ebullioscopic constant
- $m$: Molality (mol solute / kg solvent)
- $i$: van't Hoff factor (number of particles the solute dissociates into)
