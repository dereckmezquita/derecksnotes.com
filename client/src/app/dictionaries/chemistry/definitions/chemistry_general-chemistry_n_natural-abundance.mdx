<a id="natural_abundance">Natural Abundance</a> - The **relative proportion** of different [isotope](#isotope)s of an element as they occur in nature, usually expressed as a percentage.

- Measured precisely using [mass_spectrometry](#mass_spectrometry).
- Contributes to calculating average [atomic_mass](#atomic_mass) of elements.
- Reflects [nuclear_stability](#nuclear_stability) and cosmic nucleosynthesis history.
- Often used in environmental and geological studies as natural tracers.

<Alert type='note'>
Carbon-12 has ~98.9% natural abundance, while Carbon-13 is ~1.1%, crucial for understanding isotopic dating and tracing.
