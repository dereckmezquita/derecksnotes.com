<a id="activation_energy">Activation Energy</a> - The minimum energy threshold that reacting molecules must overcome in order for a chemical reaction to proceed. The Arrhenius equation famously captures the effect of activation energy on reaction rate:

$$
k = A \exp\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT}\right)
$$

where
- $ k $ is the rate constant (s$^{-1}$ or similar),
- $ A $ is the pre-exponential factor,
- $ E_a $ is the activation energy (J·mol$^{-1}$),
- $ R $ is the gas constant (8.314 J·mol$^{-1}$·K$^{-1}$),
- $ T $ is the absolute temperature (K).

**Why it matters**:
- **Catalysts** lower the effective $ E_a $ by providing an alternative reaction pathway.
- **Temperature dependence**: As $ T $ increases, $ \exp(-E_a/RT) $ grows, accelerating reactions.

While [arrhenius-acid](#arrhenius_acid) uses “Arrhenius” in a different acid-base context, the conceptual link is that **Svante Arrhenius** contributed significantly to both reaction kinetics (the Arrhenius equation) and early acid-base theory.
