<a id="entropy">Entropy</a> - Symbolised by $S$, it gauges the **disorder** or **randomness** of a system. A higher entropy means more microstates are accessible.

Often summarised:
$$
\Delta S = S_{\mathrm{final}} - S_{\mathrm{initial}}
$$

- At constant temperature, $ \Delta S = \frac{q_{\mathrm{rev}}}{T} $ for a reversible process.
- Relates to [enthalpy](#enthalpy) via $ \Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S $. An [endothermic_reaction](#endothermic_reaction) may still be spontaneous if it increases entropy sufficiently. Conversely, [exothermic_reaction](#exothermic_reaction) can become non-spontaneous if entropy drastically decreases.
- [collision_theory](#collision_theory) in gases includes random kinetic motion, reminiscent of entropy at the molecular scale.
