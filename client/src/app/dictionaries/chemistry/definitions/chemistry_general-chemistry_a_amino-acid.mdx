<a id="amino_acid">Amino Acid</a> - Organic molecules containing both an **amine group** (-NH<sub>2</sub>) and a **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH). They are considered the building blocks of proteins. A hallmark property is their [amphoteric](#amphoteric) nature, meaning they can act as an acid or base.

Amino acids are characterised by several key features:

- **Alpha Carbon**: Central carbon bonded to an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen, and a distinctive side chain (R-group).
- **Isoelectric Point (pI)**: The pH at which the molecule has no net charge overall.

If $ \mathrm{pI} $ is the midpoint between the relevant acid dissociation constants $ K_{a1} $ and $ K_{a2} $:

$$
\mathrm{pI} \approx \frac{pK_{a1} + pK_{a2}}{2}
$$

These p$K_a$ values measure the tendency of the acid/base groups to donate or accept protons. To handle these calculations in bulk, scientists rely on [Avogadro's Constant](#avogadro_constant) for conversion between microscopic (individual amino acids) and macroscopic (moles) quantities.
