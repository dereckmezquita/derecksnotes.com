<a id="faraday_constant">Faraday Constant</a> - Denoted $F$, it represents the electric charge per mole of electrons. Numerically about $96{,}485\,\mathrm{C\,mol}^{-1}$.

- Ties into [avogadro_constant](#avogadro_constant) and the elementary charge ($e$), such that $F = N_A \times e$.
- Crucial in [electrochemistry](#electrochemistry) for relating electron flow (coulombs) to moles of substance oxidised or reduced.
- In [electrolysis](#electrolysis), passing $F$ coulombs through a cell corresponds to transferring one mole of electrons.

Mathematically:
$$
F \approx 9.6485 \times 10^4 \,\mathrm{C\,mol}^{-1}
$$
