<a id="inhibitor">Inhibitor</a> - A **substance** that **slows** or **stops** a chemical reaction, in contrast to a [catalyst](#catalyst) which speeds it up. It can bind to reactive sites or otherwise raise the effective [activation_energy](#activation_energy).

- **Modes**:
  - Binding essential sites (competitive).
  - Forming side products that block reactivity.
- **Relevance**: In industrial processes or [enzyme](#enzyme)-driven pathways, controlling reaction rates is vital.
- **Relation**: [collision_theory](#collision_theory) implies fewer effective collisions if an inhibitor reduces available sites or reactivity.
