<a id="aromatic_compound">Aromatic Compound</a> - Organic compounds characterised by **conjugated pi electron systems** forming cyclic, planar rings. These structures follow **Hückel's rule** ($4n + 2$ π electrons for aromatic stability). Although commonly placed under *organic chemistry*, many fundamental principles are relevant in [general-chemistry](#aromatic_compound) contexts.


The classic example is **Benzene (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>)**:

- Highly stable ring with delocalised π electrons.
- Undergoes electrophilic substitution rather than addition reactions.

- Certain forms of carbon ([allotrope](#allotrope) structures like fullerenes) have delocalised systems akin to aromatics.
- Aromatic surfaces can exhibit unique [adsorption](#adsorption) properties, e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on environmental particulates.

*Hückel's rule* for aromaticity:
$$
(4n + 2)\pi \quad \text{electrons} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Aromatic}
$$
where $ n $ is a non-negative integer.
