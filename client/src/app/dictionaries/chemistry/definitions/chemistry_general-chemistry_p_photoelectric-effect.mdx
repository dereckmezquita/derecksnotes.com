<a id="photoelectric_effect">Photoelectric Effect</a> - Emission of electrons from matter by light absorption. Demonstrates [photon](#photon) nature of light.

Einstein's equation:
$$
E_k = hf - \phi
$$

Where:
- Eₖ = kinetic energy of ejected electron
- h = Planck's constant
- f = frequency of light
- φ = [work_function](#work_function)

Key points:
- Supports [quantum_theory](#quantum_theory)
- Shows [wave_particle_duality](#wave_particle_duality)
- Threshold frequency required
- Instantaneous process
