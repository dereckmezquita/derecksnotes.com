<a id="anion">Anion</a> - A **negatively charged ion**, formed when a neutral atom or molecule **gains electrons**. For instance, halogen atoms become **halide anions** (F<sup>-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, etc.) upon electron gain.

- **Formation**: Typically via electron transfer from metals or by the **reduction** of neutral species in redox reactions.
- **Size & Charge**: An anion's radius is generally larger than its parent atom because of increased electron-electron repulsion.
- **Relevance**: Anions often function as **counter-ions** to cations in salts and can affect the solution's acidity ([Arrhenius-acid](#arrhenius_acid) context), pH, and conductivity.

**Tip**: Knowing an element's [atomic number](#atomic_number) helps predict whether it tends to form an anion or cation by electron gain or loss.
