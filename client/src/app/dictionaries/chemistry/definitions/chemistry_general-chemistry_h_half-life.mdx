<a id="half_life">Half-Life</a> - The **time** required for **half** of a given amount of a substance (radioactive or otherwise) to **decay** or **transform**. Commonly used in nuclear [beta_decay](#beta_decay) but may also apply to other processes (e.g. radical consumption in [free_radical](#free_radical) chemistry).

The decay can often be modelled by first-order kinetics:
$$
N(t) = N_0 \times \frac{1}{2}^{\tfrac{t}{t_{1/2}}}
$$
- $t_{1/2}$ is the half-life
- $N_0$ is the initial quantity

<Alert type='note'>
In chemical kinetics, [collision_theory](#collision_theory) still influences overall reaction rates. Spontaneous radioactive decay is also subject to quantum rules, adding an element of unpredictability. Thermodynamic factors like [entropy](#entropy) can guide some non-nuclear half-life processes (e.g. slow polymer degradation).
