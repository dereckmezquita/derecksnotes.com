<a id="calorimetry">Calorimetry</a> - The **measurement** of **heat flow** into or out of a system during **chemical reactions** or **physical changes**. Data from calorimetry allow calculation of enthalpy ($\Delta H$), heat capacities, and other thermodynamic values.

- **Types**:
  - **Constant Pressure** (Coffee-cup) Calorimeter: Tracks heat at atmospheric pressure.
  - **Constant Volume** (Bomb) Calorimeter: Sealed vessel for combustion or decomposition.
- **Stoichiometry**: Linking mass changes to moles uses the [avogadro_constant](#avogadro_constant).
- **Relation**: Reaction rates ([collision_theory](#collision_theory)) and [enthalpy](#enthalpy) changes can both influence or be measured by calorimetry.
- **Key Parameter**: [heat_capacity](#heat_capacity) of the calorimeter is essential for accurate readings.

<Alert type='note'>
Calorimetry underpins many thermodynamic measurements, such as the energy content of fuels and foods.
