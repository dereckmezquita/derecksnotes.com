<a id="fission">Fission</a> - The **splitting** of a **heavy nucleus** (like uranium-235) into two or more lighter nuclei, accompanied by the release of large amounts of energy and **neutrons**.

- Governed by nuclear [binding_energy](#binding_energy), where heavier nuclei can become more stable by splitting.
- Often initiates a chain reaction if freed neutrons hit more fissionable nuclei.
- Differs from [beta_decay](#beta_decay) in scale and immediate energy yield.
- Statistical aspects (distribution of daughter nuclei) can link to nuclear [entropy](#entropy). Early quantum explorations (see [bohr_model](#bohr_model) antecedents) paved the way for fission theory.
