<a id="ketone">Ketone</a> - An **organic compound** featuring a **carbonyl group** ($\mathrm{C{=}O}$) **bonded** to **two other carbons**. General formula: R–C(=O)–R'.

- **Comparison**: Differs from an [aldehyde](#aldehyde), where one side of C=O is hydrogen.
- **Physical Properties**: Typically moderate [boiling_point](#boiling_point), higher than alkanes but lower than alcohols due to the polar [carbonyl_group](#carbonyl_group).
- **Bonding**: The $\mathrm{C{=}O}$ uses a strong [covalent_bond](#covalent_bond), often reactive in nucleophilic addition.
- Found widely in sugars (fructose, etc.) and many industrial solvents (acetone).

<Alert type='note'>
Ketones can be reduced to secondary alcohols, or further converted in oxidation or condensation reactions.
