<a id="law_of_mass_action">Law of Mass Action</a> - States that the **rate** of a chemical reaction is **proportional** to the **product of the concentrations** of the reactants, raised to their stoichiometric coefficients in the **balanced_equation**.

$$
\text{Rate} \propto [\text{A}]^{a} [\text{B}]^{b}
$$

- Forms the foundation for deriving rate laws in simple reactions (though many require experimental determination of orders).
- Ties into [chemical_equilibrium](#chemical_equilibrium) concepts and equilibrium constants.
- In acid-base contexts ([arrhenius_acid](#arrhenius_acid)), mass action describes how changes in [H<sup>+</sup>] shift reaction rates.
- [collision_theory](#collision_theory) complements it by explaining the necessity of effective collisions.

<Alert type='note'>
For complex mechanisms, the overall rate often depends on specific steps; the Law of Mass Action is an idealised base for deriving simpler rate laws.
