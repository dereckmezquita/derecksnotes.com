<a id="hydrolysis">Hydrolysis</a> - A **reaction** in which a **bond** is **broken** by **reaction** with **water**. Many biologically and industrially important processes (e.g. peptide bond cleavage, ester saponification) fall under hydrolysis.

- If a salt reacts with water, the resulting solutions can be acidic ([arrhenius_acid](#arrhenius_acid)) or basic ([arrhenius_base](#arrhenius_base)).
- Water's [amphoteric](#amphoteric) nature fosters partial ionisation or bond cleavage.
- Mechanistic details involve [collision_theory](#collision_theory), as molecules must collide with water in the right orientation and energy to break the bond.
