<a id="lyophilisation">Lyophilisation</a> - Also called **freeze-drying**, a **preservation** technique where **water** is **frozen**, then removed by **sublimation** under reduced pressure. This avoids passing through the liquid phase.

- Minimises thermal damage to sensitive materials (enzymes, pharmaceuticals, foods).
- Ties to the concept of [freeze_drying](#freeze_drying), though 'lyophilisation' is a more formal term.
- [colligative_properties](#colligative_properties) can shift freezing behaviour in solutions with solutes present.
- Often raises [entropy](#entropy) of the removed vapour but benefits the dried productâ€™s stability.

<Alert type='note'>
Lyophilisation yields porous solids that can be quickly reconstituted with minimal loss of activity, crucial in biotech and food industries.
