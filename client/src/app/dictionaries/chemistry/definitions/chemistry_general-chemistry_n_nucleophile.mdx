<a id="nucleophile">Nucleophile</a> - A chemical species that donates an [electron_pair](#electron_pair) to form a chemical bond, literally "nucleus-loving."

- Reacts with [electrophile](#electrophile)s in many organic reactions.
- Common in [substitution_reaction](#substitution_reaction)s.
- Often has lone pair [valence_electron](#valence_electron)s.
- Examples: OH⁻, NH₃, CN⁻, R₃P.

<Alert type='note'>
Nucleophilicity differs from basicity; soft nucleophiles (I⁻) may be weak bases while strong bases (OH⁻) can be hard nucleophiles.
