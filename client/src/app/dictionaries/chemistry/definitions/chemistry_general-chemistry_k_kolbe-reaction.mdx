<a id="kolbe_reaction">Kolbe Reaction</a> - Often refers to the **Kolbe electrolysis**, where **carboxylate salts** undergo **electrochemical decarboxylation** to form radicals, which then couple to form hydrocarbons.

1. **Carboxylate** ($\text{R–COO}^-$) is oxidised at the anode.  
2. CO<sub>2</sub> is released, leaving an alkyl radical which can couple to produce R–R or other by-products.

- An instance of [electrolysis](#electrolysis) using an anode that might also act as a [catalyst](#catalyst) surface.
- Reaction steps illustrate a [redox](#redox) cycle with radical intermediates and potential side reactions.
- Named after Hermann Kolbe.

<Alert type='note'>
Though overshadowed by modern synthetic methods, the Kolbe reaction historically demonstrated how electrochemical decarboxylation can build carbon–carbon bonds.
