<a id="freeze_drying">Freeze-Drying</a> - Also called lyophilisation. A **preservation** and **drying** technique where water is **frozen**, and ice is then **sublimed** under reduced pressure, bypassing the liquid phase.

- Steps:
  1. Freezing the material.
  2. Lowering pressure.
  3. [Deposition](#deposition)-like sublimation occurs, removing water.
- Advantage: Minimal thermal damage since water does not pass through a typical [boiling-point](#boiling_point).
- Influence on [entropy](#entropy) and system's [concentration](#concentration): Removing water drastically alters solute or matrix composition. 
- Common in pharmaceuticals, food, and delicate biological samples.
