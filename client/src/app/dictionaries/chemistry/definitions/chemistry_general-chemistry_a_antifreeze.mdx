<a id="antifreeze">Antifreeze</a> - A **substance** (commonly ethylene glycol or propylene glycol) added to liquids (like water) to **lower their freezing point**. This property helps prevent damage to engines, pipelines, and other systems in cold environments.

The mechanism of antifreeze action involves two key factors:

- **Colligative Properties**: Dissolved antifreeze particles disrupt water's crystalline lattice formation.
- **Hydrogen Bonding**: Glycols are [alcohol](#alcohol)-like in structure, forming hydrogen bonds that interfere with pure water's freezing pattern.

Mathematically, the freezing-point depression $ \Delta T_f $ can be estimated with:

$$
\Delta T_f = K_f \times b \times i
$$

where:
- $ K_f $ is the cryoscopic constant,
- $ b $ is the molality of solute,
- $ i $ is the van't Hoff factor (for non-electrolytes, $ i = 1 $).

High [activation-energy](#activation_energy) processes for crystal nucleation can be further elevated in mixed solutions. In automotive applications, water-antifreeze mixtures can also form non-ideal solutions or [azeotrope](#azeotrope)-like behaviour under high temperatures and pressures.
