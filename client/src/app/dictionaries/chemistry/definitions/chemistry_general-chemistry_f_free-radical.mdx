<a id="free_radical">Free Radical</a> - A species with **one or more unpaired electrons**, making it highly reactive. Commonly formed by homolytic bond cleavage or redox processes.

- Tendency to chain-react, especially in polymerisation or combustion.
- Reactions follow [collision-theory](#collision_theory), requiring sufficient energy to break stable bonds and produce radicals.
- Unpaired electrons lead to unusual [oxidation-state](#oxidation_state) assignments relative to typical [formal_charge](#formal_charge).
- Stability partly depends on an atom's [ionisation_energy](#ionisation_energy) and the radical's ability to delocalise electron density.
