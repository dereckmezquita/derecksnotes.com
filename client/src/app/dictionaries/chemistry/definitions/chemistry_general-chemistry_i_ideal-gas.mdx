<a id="ideal_gas">Ideal Gas</a> - A **theoretical gas** whose molecules:
- Occupy **negligible volume**,
- Exhibit **no intermolecular forces**,
- Move randomly with **perfectly elastic collisions**.

**Behaviour**: Follows the [gas_law](#gas_law) equations precisely ($pV = nRT$), with $R$ the [gas_constant](#gas_constant). Real gases approximate ideal behaviour at **high temperature** and **low pressure**. Linking to the [avogadro_constant](#avogadro_constant) helps relate microscopic molecule counts to macroscopic moles.

<Alert type='note'>
Deviations occur near condensation points or high pressures, where molecular volume and intermolecular attractions become significant.
