<a id="enthalpy">Enthalpy</a> - A **thermodynamic quantity** denoted by $H$, representing the **heat content** of a system at constant pressure. 

Mathematically:
$$
H = U + pV
$$
- $U$: Internal energy  
- $pV$: Pressure-volume work term  

- If $ \Delta H > 0 $, the process is [endothermic_reaction](#endothermic_reaction); if $ \Delta H < 0 $, it's [exothermic_reaction](#exothermic_reaction).
- Relates to [ebulioscopy](#ebulioscopy) when boiling point measurements involve heat exchange.
- The standard [enthalpy_of_formation](#enthalpy_of_formation) of compounds is often tabulated for reference in reaction enthalpy calculations.
