<a id="ammonia">Ammonia</a> - A **colourless**, pungent gas with the formula NH<sub>3</sub>. It dissolves readily in water, forming ammonium hydroxide (NH<sub>4</sub>OH). 

Ammonia is characterised by several key features:

- **Basic Character**: Ammonia is a weak [Arrhenius-base](#arrhenius_base) in aqueous solution, producing OH<sup>-</sup> ions.
- **Amphoteric Behaviour**: Although primarily basic, NH<sub>3</sub> can (under high pressures/temperatures) act as an acid, donating H<sup>+</sup>, thereby linking to [amphoteric](#amphoteric) chemistry.
- **Industrial Relevance**: Synthesised mainly via the Haber process, crucial for fertilisers, nitric acid production, and beyond.

When ammonia dissolves in water:
$$
\text{NH}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \; \rightleftharpoons \; \text{NH}_4^+ + \text{OH}^-
$$

Its equilibrium lies to the left, reflecting its modest basicity.
