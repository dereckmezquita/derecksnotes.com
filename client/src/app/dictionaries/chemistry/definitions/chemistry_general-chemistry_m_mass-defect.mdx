<a id="mass_defect">Mass Defect</a> - The **difference** between the sum of the **component nucleon masses** (protons + neutrons) and the **actual measured mass** of the **nucleus**. It arises because some mass is converted to **nuclear binding energy** ([binding_energy](#binding_energy)) per $E = mc^2$.

- Example: Helium nucleus mass is slightly less than combined masses of 2 protons + 2 neutrons.
- Important in [fission](#fission) or [beta_decay](#beta_decay) calculations, and describing why different [isotope](#isotope)s have varying stability.
- Explains how nuclear energy is stored or released.

<Alert type='note'>
Mass defect underscores Einsteinâ€™s principle that mass can convert to energy, essential to understanding nuclear power and astrophysical processes.
