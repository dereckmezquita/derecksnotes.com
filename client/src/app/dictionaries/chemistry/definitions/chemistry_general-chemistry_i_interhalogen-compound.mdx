<a id="interhalogen_compound">Interhalogen Compound</a> - A **molecule** consisting of **two or more different halogens** (e.g. ClF, IBr<sub>3</sub>, IF<sub>7</sub>). These can be more reactive than single-element halogens due to bond polarity and unusual oxidation states.

- **Formation**: Often via direct [halogenation](#halogenation) or reacting one halogen with another under controlled conditions.
- **Electronic Structure**: Typically explained by advanced [bohr_model](#bohr_model) expansions or MO theory with partial [covalent_bond](#covalent_bond) character.
- **Reactivity**: [collision_theory](#collision_theory) sees these as high-energy species due to bond imbalances, making them strong oxidisers or reactants.
