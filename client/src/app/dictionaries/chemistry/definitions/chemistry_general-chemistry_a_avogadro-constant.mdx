<a id="avogadro_constant">Avogadro Constant</a> - Denoted $ N_A $ or $ L $, representing the number of particles (atoms, molecules, ions) in **one mole** of a substance. Its value is approximately $ 6.02214076 \times 10^{23} \,\text{mol}^{-1} $.

**Significance**:
- Bridges **atomic scale** (individual particles) to **macroscopic scale** (moles).
- Underpins stoichiometric calculations, relating [atomic mass](#atomic_mass) in grams to the number of discrete particles.

1 mole of carbon-12 (C<sup>12</sup>):
- Weighs exactly 12 g.
- Contains $ 6.022 \times 10^{23} $ atoms.

This fundamental constant is central to chemistry's quantitative framework.
