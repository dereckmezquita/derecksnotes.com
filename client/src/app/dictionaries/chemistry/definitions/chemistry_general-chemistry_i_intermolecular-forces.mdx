<a id="intermolecular_forces">Intermolecular Forces</a> - **Attractive** or **repulsive** interactions **between molecules**, weaker than chemical bonds. Types include:

- **Van der Waals** (London dispersion, dipole-dipole)
- **Hydrogen Bonding** (particularly strong dipole-dipole)
- **Hydrophobic** effect in water-based solutions ([hydrophobic](#hydrophobic) vs. [hydration](#hydration))

Impacts [boiling_point](#boiling_point) trends, solubility, viscosity, and overall molecular assembly. Also depends on [dipole_moment](#dipole_moment) and electron distributions.
