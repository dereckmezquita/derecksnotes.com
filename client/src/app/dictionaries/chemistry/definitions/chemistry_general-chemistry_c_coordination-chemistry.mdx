<a id="coordination_chemistry">Coordination Chemistry</a> - The **study** of **complex ions** and **coordination compounds**, where a metal centre bonds to electron-pair donors (ligands). It merges concepts of geometry, bonding theory, and metal-ligand reactivity.

- **Coordination Number**: Number of donor sites attached to the metal.
- **Electronic Structure**: [quantum_mechanics](#quantum_mechanics) and crystal field or ligand field theory describe metal-ligand orbital overlaps.
- **Oxidation States**: Metals can exhibit varied [oxidation_state](#oxidation_state) in complexes.
- **Ligand Effects**: Ability to cause [delocalization](#delocalization) of electron density, altering reactivity and spectral properties.
- Houses key topics like chelation, bridging ligands, and isomerism.  
- For an example [complex_ion](#complex_ion), geometry can be tetrahedral, octahedral, square planar, etc.
