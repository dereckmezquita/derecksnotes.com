<a id="mole">Mole</a> - The **SI base unit** for **amount of substance**, symbolised **mol**. One mole contains $N_A$ entities (atoms, molecules, ions), where $N_A$ is the [avogadro_constant](#avogadro_constant), approximately $6.022 \times 10^{23}$.

- Bridges microscopic scales (particles) to macroscopic measurements (grams, litres).
- Connects [atomic_mass](#atomic_mass) in grams to stoichiometric balancing and [yield](#yield) predictions.
- [stoichiometry](#stoichiometry) fundamentally depends on mole ratios in balanced reactions.

<Alert type='important'>
The mole concept unifies chemical measurements, enabling direct calculations of reactants and products from mass or volume data.
