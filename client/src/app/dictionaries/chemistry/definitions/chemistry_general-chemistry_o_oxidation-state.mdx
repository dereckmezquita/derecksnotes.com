<a id="oxidation_state">Oxidation State</a> - The apparent charge on an atom in a molecule after assigning electrons to the more [electronegativity](#electronegativity) element.

Rules for assignment:
1. Free elements = 0
2. Group 1/2 metals = +1/+2
3. F always -1
4. O usually -2 (except peroxides -1)
5. H usually +1 (except metal hydrides -1)
6. Sum equals total charge

Common ranges:
- N: -3 to +5
- S: -2 to +6
- Mn: +2 to +7
- Cr: +2 to +6
