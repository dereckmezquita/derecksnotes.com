<a id="kekule_structure">Kekulé Structure</a> - A **classical representation** of **benzene** (or other aromatic compounds) as a **cyclic** molecule with **alternating single** and **double** bonds. Proposed by Friedrich August Kekulé.

- **Issue**: Actual benzene (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) exhibits electron [delocalization](#delocalization) across all six carbons, not discrete double/single bonds.
- **Modern Understanding**: Resonance hybrids unify these [covalent_bond](#covalent_bond) depictions into a single structure with partial bond orders.
- **Relation**: [aromaticity](#aromaticity) concepts refine Kekulé’s idea, emphasising stability due to cyclic pi-electron cloud.
- **Examples**: [benzene_c6h6](#benzene_c6h6) often drawn with two Kekulé forms in resonance.

<Alert type='note'>
Though historic, Kekulé’s model sparked the notion of ring structures and resonance, bridging classical valence ideas with quantum insights.
