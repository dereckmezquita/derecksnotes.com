<a id="hess_law">Hess' Law</a> - The **enthalpy change** ($\Delta H$) of an overall **reaction** is the **sum** of the enthalpy changes of the **individual steps**, regardless of the reaction path.

- Often used to deduce $\Delta H_\text{reaction}$ by combining known enthalpies from sub-reactions.
- Ties to [enthalpy](#enthalpy) being a **state function**, meaning path independence.
- Common approach: Summing [enthalpy_of_formation](#enthalpy_of_formation) values for products minus that of reactants in the [balanced_equation](#balanced_equation).
- Saves time vs. measuring each reaction path step experimentally.
