<a id="daltons_law">Dalton's Law</a> - Also known as the **law of partial pressures**. It states that in a **mixture of non-reactive gases**, the **total pressure** ($P_{\mathrm{total}}$) is the **sum** of the **partial pressures** ($P_i$) of each component gas:

$$
P_{\mathrm{total}} = \sum_i P_i
$$

- Partial pressure $P_i$ is the pressure a gas would exert if it alone occupied the container.
- Connects to the [ideal_gas](#ideal_gas) equation and [gas_constant](#gas_constant) concepts when relating partial pressures to moles and temperature.
- Converting partial pressures to mole fractions often involves the [avogadro_constant](#avogadro_constant).

  Understanding each gas's [partial_pressure](#partial_pressure) helps predict gas behaviour in mixtures, from atmospheric science to industrial gas processes.
