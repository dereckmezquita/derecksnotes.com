<a id="ampholyte">Ampholyte</a> - A substance that can **ionise** both as an acid and a base, similar to an [amphoteric](#amphoteric) species but typically referring to molecules that can form both cations and anions depending on pH. Many [amino-acids](#amino_acid) behave as ampholytes, existing in zwitterionic forms at certain pH levels.

Ampholytes are characterised by several key features:

- **pH Dependence**: Ampholytes' net charge changes with solution pH, guiding their behaviour in electrophoresis and ionic equilibria.
- **Relevance**: Important in biological systems, where buffers often contain ampholytes to stabilise pH.
- **Arrhenius Perspective**: As potential [arrhenius-acid](#arrhenius_acid) or -base donors, ampholytes handle H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>-</sup> in solution.

Such species can be cationic, neutral, or anionic, illustrating their multifunctional acid-base roles.
