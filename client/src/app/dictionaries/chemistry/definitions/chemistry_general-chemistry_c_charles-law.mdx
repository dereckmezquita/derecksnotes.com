<a id="charles_law">Charles' Law</a> - States that the **volume** of a **fixed amount** of gas at **constant pressure** is **directly proportional** to its **absolute temperature** ($T$):

$$
\frac{V}{T} = \mathrm{constant}
$$

- Explains why balloons expand when heated at constant $p$.  
- Incorporates idea of [collision_theory](#collision_theory) in that higher temperature increases molecular speed, demanding larger volume.  
- Part of the combined [gas_law](#gas_law) equations.  
- Conversions from $V$-related data to molar terms might use the [avogadro_constant](#avogadro_constant).
- Affected also by external factors like [boiling_point](#boiling_point) if the temperature is high enough to vaporise the gas or shift phases.

<Alert type='note'>
Charles' Law is integral for balloonists, meteorologists, and general predictions of how gases behave with temperature changes.
