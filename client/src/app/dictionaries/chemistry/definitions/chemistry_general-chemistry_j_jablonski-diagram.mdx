<a id="jablonski_diagram">Jablonski Diagram</a> - A **visual representation** of **electronic states** and **transitions** in molecules, depicting **absorption**, **fluorescence**, **phosphorescence**, and **non-radiative** pathways.

- Arrows show transitions between singlet and triplet [energy_level](#energy_level)s.  
- Explains how [fluorescence](#fluorescence) or phosphorescence emerges, tying in with [quantum_mechanics](#quantum_mechanics) for spin states.  
- **Internal Conversion**: Non-radiative drop between states of the same spin multiplicity.  
- **Inter-System Crossing**: Crossing between singlet and triplet states.  
- In practice, collisional deactivation ([collision_theory](#collision_theory)) and vibrational relaxation can quench or shift emission.

A Jablonski diagram helps rationalise photophysical and photochemical events, including energy transfer in photosynthesis or laser dyes.
