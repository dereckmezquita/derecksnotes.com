<a id="adsorption">Adsorption</a> - The accumulation of molecules on the **surface** of a solid or liquid, creating a higher concentration at the interface than in the bulk. This phenomenon contrasts with [absorption](#absorption), where the material diffuses into the volume.

Two primary types of adsorption are distinguished:

- **Physisorption**: Involves weak van der Waals forces.
- **Chemisorption**: Involves stronger chemical bonding at the surface.

A simple way to model adsorption is through **Langmuir isotherms**, describing how the quantity of adsorbate on a surface varies with its partial pressure or concentration:

$$
\theta = \frac{K p}{1 + K p}
$$

where
- $ \theta $ is the fraction of the surface covered by adsorbate,
- $ K $ is the adsorption equilibrium constant,
- $ p $ is the partial pressure of the adsorbate.

Many [allotropes](#allotrope) of carbon (like activated carbon) serve as excellent adsorbents in water purification and gas separation.
