<a id="absorption">Absorption</a> - The process by which one substance (the absorbate) **penetrates** and becomes uniformly distributed throughout another (the absorbent). In contrast to [adsorption](#adsorption), where molecules are only held on the surface, absorption involves a full assimilation into the bulk of the material.

- **Physical absorption**: Typically driven by intermolecular forces, such as van der Waals interactions (e.g. carbon dioxide dissolving in water).
- **Chemical absorption**: Involves a chemical reaction, resulting in products bound or changed at the molecular level (e.g. reactive gases absorbed by alkaline solutions).

**Beer-Lambert law** is a fundamental principle in absorption spectroscopy, describing the relationship between absorbance and the concentration of an absorbing species.

A common context is light absorption in a medium:

$$
A = \epsilon \, l \, c
$$

where
- $ A $ is the absorbance (unitless),
- $ \epsilon $ is the molar absorptivity (L·mol$^{-1}$·cm$^{-1}$),
- $ l $ is the path length of the sample (cm),
- $ c $ is the concentration of the absorbing species (mol·L$^{-1}$).
