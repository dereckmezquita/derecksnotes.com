<a id="lewis_base">Lewis Base</a> - Any **species** capable of **donating** an **electron pair**, typically to form a **coordinate bond**. Contrasts with [arrhenius_base](#arrhenius_base) which donates OH<sup>-</sup> but focuses only on aqueous solutions.

- A [lewis_base](#lewis_base) + [lewis_acid](#lewis_acid) often yields a [complex_ion](#complex_ion).
- Typical examples: NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, halide ions, or any electron-rich site.
- Emphasises [dative_bond](#dative_bond) formation as a unifying acid-base concept across many chemical contexts.

<Alert type='note'>
The Lewis definition is broad, explaining acid-base behaviour in non-aqueous solvents or advanced inorganic and organic reactions.
