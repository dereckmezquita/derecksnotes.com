<a id="atomic_number">Atomic Number</a> - The **number of protons** in the nucleus of an atom, uniquely identifying the element. Symbolised as *Z*, it defines the position of the element in the periodic table:

- Hydrogen (H) has $ Z = 1 $
- Helium (He) has $ Z = 2 $
- Lithium (Li) has $ Z = 3 $

**Important distinctions**:
- **[Atomic mass](#atomic_mass)** includes protons and neutrons.
- **Isotopes** of the same element have the same *Z* but different neutron counts.
- **Electron configuration** and [atomic orbitals](#atomic_orbital) are determined by *Z*, as it sets the electrostatic attraction between nucleus and electrons.
