<a id="junction_potential">Junction Potential</a> - A **voltage difference** that forms **at the interface** between **two electrolyte solutions** (or between a metal and an electrolyte) due to **ion concentration** or mobility differences.

- A small, often unwanted offset in cells, complicating [electrochemistry](#electrochemistry) measurements.  
- Minimised by using salt bridges or carefully chosen reference electrodes.  
- Ties into [electrode_potential](#electrode_potential) corrections for accurate $E$ readings.  
- [collision_theory](#collision_theory) on ionic transport plus solution drift can intensify or reduce this potential. 

<Alert type='note'>
Accurate pH or redox measurements depend on reducing junction potentials. Analytical methods must account for or calibrate against them.
