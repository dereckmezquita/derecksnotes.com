<a id="fluorescence">Fluorescence</a> - The **emission of light** by a substance that has **absorbed** electromagnetic radiation. Often occurs when an electron in an excited state **relaxes** to a lower energy state, emitting a photon.

- Timescale: Typically very fast (nanoseconds).
- [Electronegativity](#electronegativity) and bonding environment shift the absorption/emission wavelengths.
- Electron transitions are governed by [quantum_mechanics](#quantum_mechanics) and discrete [energy_level](#energy_level) spacings.
- Coulombic interactions ([coulombs_law](#coulombs_law)) shape excited-state orbital energies.
