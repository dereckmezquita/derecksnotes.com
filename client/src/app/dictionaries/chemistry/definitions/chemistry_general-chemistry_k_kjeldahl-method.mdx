<a id="kjeldahl_method">Kjeldahl Method</a> - A **classical laboratory technique** to **determine nitrogen content** in organic substances. It involves **digestion** of a sample in strong [acid](#acid), converting nitrogen to ammonium sulphate, then **distillation** with strong [base](#base) to release [ammonia](#ammonia).

- **Distillation**: Freed ammonia is collected in a trapping solution, then titrated to find total nitrogen.
- Relevance: Used in protein assays, fertiliser analysis, etc.
- Heat control or [calorimetry](#calorimetry) may be used if large-scale digestion is monitored.
- The method is robust but labour-intensive, replaced in some applications by modern automated instruments.
