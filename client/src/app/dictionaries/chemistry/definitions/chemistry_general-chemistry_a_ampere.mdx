<a id="ampere">Ampere</a> - The **SI base unit** of electric current (symbol A). Current flow often underlies redox processes, electroplating, and various aspects of solution conductivity in chemistry.

Usage of the ampere in chemistry is widespread, with several key applications:

- **Electrolysis**: The magnitude of current, measured in amperes, directly ties to the rate at which a substance (e.g. [ammonium](#ammonium) conversion) is oxidised or reduced.
- **Faraday's Laws**: These laws link charge passed in coulombs (C) to moles of substance. Recall $ 1 \,\text{A} = 1 \,\text{C/s} $.
- **Amphoteric**: The concept of a current in solution can demonstrate how [amphoteric](#amphoteric) species sometimes behave differently at electrodes, either losing or gaining protons/electrons.

Given charge $ Q $ and time $ t $:
$$
I (\text{A}) = \frac{Q (\text{C})}{t (\text{s})}
$$

[Avogadro-constant](#avogadro_constant) often assists in bridging microscopic electron counts and macroscopic measurements of electric current.
