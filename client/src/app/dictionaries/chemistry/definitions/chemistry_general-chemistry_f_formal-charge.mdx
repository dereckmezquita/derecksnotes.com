<a id="formal_charge">Formal Charge</a> - A **theoretical charge** assigned to an atom in a molecule or ion, based on an **equal sharing** of bonding electrons. Helps predict **most stable** resonance structures.

- Calculation per atom:  
  $$ 
  \text{Formal Charge} = \text{Valence Electrons} - \bigl(\text{Non-bonding Electrons} + \tfrac{1}{2}\times \text{Bonding Electrons}\bigr)
  $$
- Minimising total formal charges often indicates the most plausible structure.
- In [covalent_bond](#covalent_bond) frameworks, formal-charge assignment is central. For a [complex_ion](#complex_ion), it's similarly used for each ligand and the metal centre.
- Effects: Large formal charges can indicate strong electrostatic forces (see [coulombs_law](#coulombs_law)) or possible [ampholyte](#ampholyte) reactivity.
