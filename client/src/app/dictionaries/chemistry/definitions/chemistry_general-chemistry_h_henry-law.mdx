<a id="henry_law">Henry's Law</a> - States that the **solubility** of a **gas** in a **liquid** is **directly proportional** to the **partial pressure** of that gas above the solution:

$$
p = k_H \, x
$$

- $p$: Partial pressure of the gas
- $x$: Mole fraction of the gas in the solution
- $k_H$: Henry's law constant (depends on gas-liquid pair)

Essential for gas [solutions](#solutions), carbonated beverages, and comparing partial pressures under [gas_law](#gas_law) conditions. Changes in pressure or temperature can shift the gas solubility, sometimes affecting the [boiling_point](#boiling_point) or [colligative_properties](#colligative_properties) in mixtures.

<Alert type='note'>
Henry's law applies best under low gas solubility and near-ideal conditions. Deviations occur with chemical reactions or strong gas-liquid interactions.
