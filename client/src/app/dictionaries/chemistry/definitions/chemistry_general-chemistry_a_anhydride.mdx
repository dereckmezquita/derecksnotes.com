<a id="anhydride">Anhydride</a> - A compound formed by **removing a water molecule** (H<sub>2</sub>O) from another substance, often from acids. The most common are **acid anhydrides**, which yield the parent acid upon reaction with water.

Anhydride types include:

- **Organic Acid Anhydrides**: e.g. acetic anhydride, (CH<sub>3</sub>CO)<sub>2</sub>O, widely used in synthesis (e.g. to form esters or amides).
- **Inorganic Anhydrides**: e.g. SO<sub>3</sub> (sulfur trioxide), the anhydride of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (sulfuric acid).

Hydrolysis Reaction:

$$
\text{R}_2\text{O} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \;\longrightarrow\; 2 \,\text{R}\text{OH}
$$
(For a generic symmetrical anhydride forming two [alcohol](#alcohol)s.)

Strongly related to [arrhenius-acid](#arrhenius_acid) chemistry, as many anhydrides react vigorously to produce or regenerate acids. They can also be synthesised from partial oxidation or dehydration of [aldehydes](#aldehyde).
