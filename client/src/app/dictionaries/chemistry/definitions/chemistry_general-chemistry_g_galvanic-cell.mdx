<a id="galvanic_cell">Galvanic Cell</a> - An **electrochemical cell** that spontaneously converts **chemical energy** into **electrical energy** by a **redox** reaction. In a typical galvanic cell:

- Oxidation occurs at the anode, reduction at the cathode.
- Each electrode is immersed in a distinct half-cell solution, connected by a salt bridge.
- The cell's potential relates to [electrode_potential](#electrode_potential) values, measured in volts.
- Thermodynamics connects cell potential ($E$) and [entropy](#entropy) or free energy ($\Delta G$). 
- The link to [electrochemistry](#electrochemistry) is direct, and experimental mole calculations often involve the [avogadro_constant](#avogadro_constant).

<Alert type='note'>
Galvanic cells are the basis for batteries (e.g. Zn-Cu Daniell cell), enabling portable power through spontaneous redox reactions.
