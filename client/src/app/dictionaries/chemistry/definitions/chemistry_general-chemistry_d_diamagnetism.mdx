<a id="diamagnetism">Diamagnetism</a> - A **weak** magnetic response observed in materials where **all electrons** are **paired**, causing a slight **repulsion** from external magnetic fields. This effect arises from **induced** magnetic dipoles that oppose the applied field.

- Contrasts with paramagnetism (unpaired electrons) or ferromagnetism (aligned domains).
- In [coordination_chemistry](#coordination_chemistry), the [oxidation_state](#oxidation_state) and electron count can lead to either dia- or paramagnetic complexes.
- [quantum_mechanics](#quantum_mechanics) explains diamagnetism through subtle electron orbital responses.
- Even seemingly non-magnetic substances exhibit diamagnetism to a tiny degree, including water or [complex_ion](#complex_ion)s.
