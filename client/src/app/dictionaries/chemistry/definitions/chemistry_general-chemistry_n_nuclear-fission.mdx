<a id="nuclear_fission">Nuclear Fission</a> - The splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter elements, releasing energy and often neutrons. Common example:

$$
^{235}\text{U} + n \rightarrow ^{236}\text{U} \rightarrow ^{92}\text{Kr} + ^{141}\text{Ba} + 3n + \text{energy}
$$

- Energy release explained by [mass_defect](#mass_defect) and [binding_energy](#binding_energy) differences.
- Can initiate [chain_reaction](#chain_reaction)s in nuclear reactors.
- Probability depends on target nucleus [nuclear_stability](#nuclear_stability).
- Primary source of nuclear power generation.

<Alert type='note'>
Controlled fission in reactors versus uncontrolled in weapons illustrates importance of neutron moderation.
