<a id="knudsen_diffusion">Knudsen Diffusion</a> - A **transport mechanism** in **porous media** when **pore diameter** is **so small** that **molecular collisions** with the **pore walls** dominate over intermolecular collisions. Gas molecules behave almost independently within the pores.

- Occurs at **low pressure** or with very narrow channels.
- Different from normal [diffusion](#diffusion) (where molecules collide predominantly with each other).
- [collision_theory](#collision_theory) modifies to account for wall impacts rather than molecule-molecule collisions.
- Common in catalytic processes through a [porous_medium](#porous_medium) or microfluidic channels.

<Alert type='note'>
Knudsen diffusion is vital in designing and interpreting membrane separations, microporous catalyst behaviour, and vacuum systems.
