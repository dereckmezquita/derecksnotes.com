<a id="malleability">Malleability</a> - A **physical property** of **metals** (and certain alloys) describing their capacity to be **hammered** or **rolled** into thin sheets **without breaking**. It stems from the ability of atoms in a [metallic_bond](#metallic_bond) lattice to rearrange under stress.

- **Mechanism**: Layers of metal atoms can slide over each other if the bonding is non-directional.
- **Influences**: Temperature, impurity content, [crystal_structure](#crystal_structure), and presence of [vacancies](#vacancies).
- [Entropy](#entropy) factors in slightly, as more disordered metal lattices can deform more easily.

<Alert type='note'>
Malleability contrasts with brittleness. Gold is notably malleable, while ionic crystals generally shatter when struck.
