<a id="binary_mixture">Binary Mixture</a> - A **two-component** mixture (e.g. ethanol-water). Behaviour often differs from that of pure substances:

- **Vapour-Liquid Equilibria**: Simple or complicated, can form an [azeotrope](#azeotrope).
- **Boiling Changes**: Adding a second component can shift the [boiling_point](#boiling_point).
- **Mixing**: Intermolecular forces, partial miscibility, or complete solutions can arise. 
- Kinetically, [collision_theory](#collision_theory) in reacting binary mixtures can be altered by solvation or molecular interactions.

<Alert type='note'>
Binary mixtures serve as the basis for studying more complex [solutions](#solutions) with multiple components.
