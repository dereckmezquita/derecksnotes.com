<a id="azeotrope">Azeotrope</a> - A mixture of two or more liquids whose proportions **cannot** be altered by simple distillation, as the vapour has the **same composition** as the liquid mixture. This phenomenon reflects strong intermolecular interactions that defy typical Raoult's law predictions.

- **Minimum-Boiling Azeotrope**: Commonly seen with ethanol-water (~95.6% ethanol by volume).
- **Maximum-Boiling Azeotrope**: Found in certain hydrochloric acid solutions where the solution vaporises at a higher temperature than either component alone.
- **Applications**: Azeotrope formation can complicate purification processes; advanced techniques (e.g. pressure-swing distillation or [absorption](#absorption) columns) are employed to break azeotropes.

For a **binary** mixture, an ideal solution might follow:
$$
p_{\text{total}} = x_1 p_1^\circ + x_2 p_2^\circ
$$
Yet real mixtures deviate significantly (excess enthalpy, unusual [activation-energy](#activation_energy) considerations), leading to these azeotropic points.
