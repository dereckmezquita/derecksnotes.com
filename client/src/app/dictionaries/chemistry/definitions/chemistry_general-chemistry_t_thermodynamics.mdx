<a id="thermodynamics">Thermodynamics</a> - Study of energy transformations and their relationship to system changes.

Laws:
1. Energy conserved (ΔE = q + w)
2. [entropy](#entropy) increases (ΔS_universe > 0)
3. S = 0 at 0 K (perfect crystal)

Key functions:
- [enthalpy](#enthalpy): H = E + PV
- [gibbs_energy](#gibbs_energy): G = H - TS
- Work: w = -PΔV (expansion)

Determines reaction [spontaneity](#spontaneity).
