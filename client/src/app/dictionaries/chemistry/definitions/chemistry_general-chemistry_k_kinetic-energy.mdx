<a id="kinetic_energy">Kinetic Energy</a> - The **energy** an object or particle has due to its **motion**. In chemistry, vital for understanding **molecular speeds** and **reaction rates**.

$$
E_\mathrm{k} = \frac{1}{2}\, m\, v^2
$$

- Gas molecules: The average KE relates directly to [temperature](#temperature).  
- [collision_theory](#collision_theory) depends on whether kinetic energy exceeds the activation threshold.  
- Some [gas_law](#gas_law) formulations assume ideal molecules with KE distribution per Maxwell-Boltzmann.  
- Changes in KE can reflect bond or phase changes, connecting with [enthalpy](#enthalpy) in macroscopic processes.

<Alert type='important'>
Kinetic energy drives diffusion, effusion, and collisions essential to chemical reactivity and equilibria.
