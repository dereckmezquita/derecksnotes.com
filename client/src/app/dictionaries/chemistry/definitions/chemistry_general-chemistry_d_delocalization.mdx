<a id="delocalization">Delocalization</a> - The **spread** of **electrons** across **multiple atoms** or bonds, rather than confinement to a single site. 

- Common in **conjugated** pi systems (benzene ring, polyenes) or metals in [coordination_chemistry](#coordination_chemistry).
- Resonance structures illustrate electron [resonance](#resonance) but physically, the electrons exist in a merged orbital framework.
- [covalent_bond](#covalent_bond) models sometimes cannot capture delocalised electrons fully; [quantum_mechanics](#quantum_mechanics) wavefunctions do better.
- Lowers overall energy, stabilising the system (aromatic stability, metallic conduction, etc.).

<Alert type='note'>
Delocalisation underpins phenomena like aromaticity, metallic bonding, and certain "3-centre-2-electron" bridging in main group compounds.
