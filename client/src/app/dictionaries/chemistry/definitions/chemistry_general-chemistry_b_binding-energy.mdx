<a id="binding_energy">Binding Energy</a> - The **energy required** to **separate** a system into its constituent parts. Broadly includes:
- **Nuclear Binding Energy**: Holds protons and neutrons together, important in [beta_decay](#beta_decay).
- **Atomic** or **Electronic** Transitions: Relates to spectral lines, such as those in the [balmer_series](#balmer_series).
- **Molecular**: Sometimes conflated with [bond_energy](#bond_energy), though binding can refer to entire complexes.

If binding is strong, it can stabilise species in [redox](#redox) contexts or hamper decomposition. Negative binding energy indicates stability upon formation.

<Alert type='note'>
In nuclear chemistry, binding energy explains why heavier nuclei can release energy via fission or decay. In atomic/molecular contexts, it underpins electron orbital energies.
