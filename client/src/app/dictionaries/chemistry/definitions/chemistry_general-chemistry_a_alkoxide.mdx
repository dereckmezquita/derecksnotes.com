<a id="alkoxide">Alkoxide</a> - Conjugate bases derived from [alcohols](#alcohol) by deprotonation of the hydroxyl group. Formally written as R-O<sup>-</sup>, they serve as **strong bases** and **nucleophiles** in both laboratory and industrial organic reactions.

Alkoxides are characterised by several key features:

- **Preparation**: Reacting alcohols with alkali metals or strong [arrhenius-base](#arrhenius_base) can yield alkoxides.
- **Reactivity**: Alkoxides can perform nucleophilic substitutions, facilitate esterification, and more.
- **Ionic Character**: R-O<sup>-</sup> is an [anion](#anion), often stabilised by cationic counterparts like Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup>.

$$
\text{R-O}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \;\longrightarrow\; \text{ROH} + \text{OH}^-
$$

Alkoxides highlight the acid-base interplay, as their formation is contingent on the acidity of the parent alcohol.
