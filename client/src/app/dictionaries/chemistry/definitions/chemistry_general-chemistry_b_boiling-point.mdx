<a id="boiling_point">Boiling Point</a> - The **temperature** at which a liquid's **vapour pressure** equals **external pressure**, causing **vaporisation** throughout the bulk.

- **Influences**: Ambient pressure (see [barometer](#barometer)), solution composition ([binary_mixture](#binary_mixture)), and added solutes ([colligative_properties](#colligative_properties)).
- Standard boiling point: Measured at 1 bar (about 100Â°C for pure water). Historically, 1 atm was used.
- **Elevation**: The presence of solute can cause a [boiling_point_elevation](#boiling_point_elevation), a prime example of colligative effects.

<Alert type='note'>
Boiling point data are crucial in distillation, cooking science, and chemical process design. Pressure manipulation or solute addition can modify it significantly.
