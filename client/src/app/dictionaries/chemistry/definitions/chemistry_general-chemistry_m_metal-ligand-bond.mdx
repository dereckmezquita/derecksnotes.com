<a id="metal_ligand_bond">Metal-Ligand Bond</a> - The **coordinate bond** formed between a **metal centre** and a **ligand** in [coordination_chemistry](#coordination_chemistry). Often described as a [dative_bond](#dative_bond) with the metal accepting electron pairs.

- Stability and properties depend on metalâ€™s [oxidation_state](#oxidation_state) and ligand type.
- Defines geometry in a [complex_ion](#complex_ion): octahedral, tetrahedral, square planar, etc.
- Impacts reactivity, catalytic behaviour, and spectroscopic characteristics.

<Alert type='note'>
Metal-ligand interactions underlie catalytic cycles, electron transfers, and biological processes like oxygen transport in haemoglobin.
