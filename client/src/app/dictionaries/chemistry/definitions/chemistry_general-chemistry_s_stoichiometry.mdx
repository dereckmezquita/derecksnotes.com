<a id="stoichiometry">Stoichiometry</a> - Quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions. Based on [balanced_equation](#balanced_equation)s.

Key calculations:
- [mole](#mole) ratios
- Mass relationships
- [limiting_reagent](#limiting_reagent)
- [theoretical_yield](#theoretical_yield)

Example:
$$
\text{2H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{2H}_2\text{O}
$$
- 2 mol H₂ : 1 mol O₂
- 4g H₂ : 32g O₂
- Yields 36g H₂O
