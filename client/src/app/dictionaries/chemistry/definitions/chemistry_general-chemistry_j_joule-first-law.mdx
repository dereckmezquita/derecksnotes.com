<a id="joule_first_law">Joule's First Law</a> - Also known as the **Joule-Lenz law**, it states that the **heat** ($Q$) **generated** by an **electric current** ($I$) flowing through a **resistor** ($R$) for time $t$ is:

$$
Q = I^2 \, R \, t
$$

- Ties to [electrochemistry](#electrochemistry) in cells or circuits, where electrical energy dissipates as heat.  
- Also relevant to reaction [enthalpy](#enthalpy) if the energy is used for collisions or bond disruption ([collision_theory](#collision_theory)).  
- Named after James Prescott [joule](#joule) and Heinrich Lenz.
