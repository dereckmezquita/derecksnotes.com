<a id="decantation">Decantation</a> - A **mechanical separation** process where **liquid** is **poured off** from a **solid** or **heavier liquid** once it has settled at the bottom or formed a distinct layer.

- **Usage**: Removal of supernatant from precipitates, or separating immiscible layers (oil-water).
- **Contrast**: [distillation](#distillation) involves phase change via heating; decantation is simpler, using gravity or minimal equipment.
- **Kinetics**: In contexts of [collision_theory](#collision_theory), flocculants can promote particle aggregation to speed settling.
- **Relevance**: For adjusting [concentration](#concentration) of components before further analysis or disposal.

<Alert type='note'>
Wine-making, wastewater treatment, and lab work often rely on decantation to gently remove clear liquid from settled solids.
