<a id="kinetic_product">Kinetic Product</a> - The **product** of a reaction pathway that **forms fastest** (i.e. requires the **lowest [activation_energy](#activation_energy)**), though it may not always be the **most stable**. Often contrasted with the [thermodynamic-product](#thermodynamic_product).

- **Low-temperature** or short-reaction conditions favour kinetic product formation.
- [collision_theory](#collision_theory) emphasises that faster reaction paths yield immediate products.
- If equilibrium or extra time/heat is allowed, the reaction may shift towards a thermodynamically more stable outcome.
- Energy diagrams show an early (low) barrier, but a higher final [enthalpy](#enthalpy) relative to the thermodynamic product.

<Alert type='note'>
Knowing whether a reaction is under 'kinetic control' or 'thermodynamic control' is crucial in designing synthetic protocols.
