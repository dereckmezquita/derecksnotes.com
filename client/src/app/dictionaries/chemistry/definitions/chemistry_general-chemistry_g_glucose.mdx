<a id="glucose">Glucose</a> - A **monosaccharide** (simple sugar) with the formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. It's a **primary energy source** in biology and a crucial substrate for [fermentation](#fermentation).

- Often crystallises in ring form (pyranose).
- In solution, it exhibits equilibrium between alpha and beta anomers.
- Water solutions of glucose can show [colligative_properties](#colligative_properties) like boiling-point elevation or freezing-point depression.
- The [enthalpy](#enthalpy) of glucose combustion is used to measure caloric content in food science.

<Alert type='note'>
Though vital for metabolism, excessive glucose intake can disrupt homeostasis. In biochemical contexts, partial oxidation or fermentation yields myriad products.
