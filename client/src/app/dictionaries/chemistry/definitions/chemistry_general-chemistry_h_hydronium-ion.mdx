<a id="hydronium_ion">Hydronium Ion</a> - An oxygen cation attached to three protons, its composition is written as H3O+. This is different from R3O+ known as a [oxonium ion](#oxonium_ion) and instead of three protons can include any other groups. A [hydronium ion](#Hydronium_Ion) is an oxonium ion, but the inverse is not true; as this term refers specifically to ions which have hydrogens.
