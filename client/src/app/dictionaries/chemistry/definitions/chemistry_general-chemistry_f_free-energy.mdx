<a id="free_energy">Free Energy</a> - Often referring to the **Gibbs Free Energy** ($G$) at constant pressure and temperature. It dictates the **spontaneity** of a reaction.

- Formula:  
  $$ 
  G = H - T\,S 
  $$
  where $H$ is [enthalpy](#enthalpy), $T$ is temperature (K), and $S$ is [entropy](#entropy).
- Negative $\Delta G$: Reaction is spontaneous; positive $\Delta G$: non-spontaneous.
- Ties to [endothermic_reaction](#endothermic_reaction) or exothermic conditions, factoring in entropy changes.
- At [chemical_equilibrium](#chemical_equilibrium), $\Delta G = 0$.
