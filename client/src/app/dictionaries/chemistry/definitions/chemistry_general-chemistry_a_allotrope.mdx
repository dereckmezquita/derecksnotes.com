<a id="allotrope">Allotrope</a> - Different **structural forms** of the same element, characterised by distinct physical and chemical properties. A classic example is carbon, which can appear as:
- **Diamond**: Each carbon is sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridised in a tetrahedral network.
- **Graphite**: Carbon atoms form planar hexagonal sheets; these sheets are loosely held together, allowing for lubrication and layered structures.
- **Buckminsterfullerene (C<sub>60</sub>)**: A spherical “buckyball” arrangement.
- **Graphene**: A single layer of graphite with extraordinary electrical and mechanical properties.

Allotropes can drastically differ in hardness, conductivity, and [adsorption](#adsorption) capacity (e.g. activated carbon).
