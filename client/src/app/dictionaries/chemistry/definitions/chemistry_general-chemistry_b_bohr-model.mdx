<a id="bohr_model">Bohr Model</a> - A **historic atomic model** proposed by Niels Bohr for the **hydrogen atom**, featuring **quantised orbits** for electrons. 

- Explains the discrete spectral lines observed in the [balmer_series](#balmer_series).
- Despite overshadowed by modern [quantum_mechanics](#quantum_mechanics), it remains a cornerstone in atomic theory.
- [beta_decay](#beta_decay) expansions eventually revealed deeper nuclear interactions, beyond Bohr's scope.
- Relation to [bond_energy](#bond_energy): Early shell models hinted at how electron arrangement affects chemical bonding, though not fully accurate for multi-electron atoms.
