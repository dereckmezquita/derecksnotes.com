<a id="j_coupling">J-Coupling</a> - A **through-bond** spin-spin coupling phenomenon in **nuclear magnetic resonance** ([nmr-spectroscopy](#nmr_spectroscopy)). Arises from **indirect** interactions transmitted by electrons in a [covalent_bond](#covalent_bond).

- Not reliant on dipole-dipole interactions, but electron-mediated.  
- Magnitude measured in **hertz (Hz)**.  
- Typically explained by [quantum_mechanics](#quantum_mechanics) regarding orbital overlaps and partial [delocalization](#delocalization) of electron density.  
- Useful in determining coupling patterns, connectivity, and structural details in organic molecules.
