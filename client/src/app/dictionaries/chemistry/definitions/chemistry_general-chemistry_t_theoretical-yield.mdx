<a id="theoretical_yield">Theoretical Yield</a> - Maximum product amount possible from given reactants based on [stoichiometry](#stoichiometry) and [limiting_reagent](#limiting_reagent).

Calculations:

$$
\text{Percent yield} = \frac{\text{Actual yield}}{\text{Theoretical yield}} \times 100\%
$$

Factors affecting [percent_yield](#percent_yield):
- Competing reactions
- Reversible reactions
- Incomplete reactions
- Product loss in isolation

Example yields:
- Industrial: 80-90%
- Laboratory: 60-80%
- Complex synthesis: < 50%
