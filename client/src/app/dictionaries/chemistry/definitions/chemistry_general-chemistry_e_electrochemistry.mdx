<a id="electrochemistry">Electrochemistry</a> - The **branch of chemistry** concerned with **electron transfer** processes, redox reactions, and electric currents. It unites concepts of oxidation-reduction, electrode potentials, and conductance.

It intersects with [collision_theory](#collision_theory) when describing how ions and electrons collide at electrode surfaces. For instance, an [arrhenius_acid](#arrhenius_acid) can donate protons that may affect electrode equilibria. Quantifying these reactions often involves the [avogadro_constant](#avogadro_constant) to relate coulombs of charge to moles of electrons. In processes like [electrolysis](#electrolysis), an external voltage drives non-spontaneous redox reactions.
