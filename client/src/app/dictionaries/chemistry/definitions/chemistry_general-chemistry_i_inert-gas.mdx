<a id="inert_gas">Inert Gas</a> - Also called a **noble gas**, it **rarely** participates in chemical reactions due to a **filled valence shell** (e.g. He, Ne, Ar). From a [bohr_model](#bohr_model) or modern quantum perspective, their [ground_state](#ground_state) electron configurations are extremely stable.

- **Minimal Reactivity**: High ionisation energies, stable [oxidation_state](#oxidation_state) of zero.
- **Applications**: Providing non-reactive atmospheres in welding, storing reactive chemicals, or controlling [collision_theory](#collision_theory) conditions in experimental setups.

<Alert type='important'>
Though called 'inert', heavier noble gases (e.g. xenon) can form compounds under extreme conditions (e.g. XeF<sub>2</sub>).
