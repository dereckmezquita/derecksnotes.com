<a id="enthalpy_of_formation">Enthalpy of Formation</a> - The **enthalpy change** ($\Delta H_f^\circ$) for **forming** one **mole** of a compound from its elemental states under standard conditions (25Â°C, 1 bar).

- A building block for calculating reaction enthalpies via Hess' Law and a [balanced_equation](#balanced_equation).
- Often measured with [calorimetry](#calorimetry) or deduced from known enthalpies plus theoretical [quantum_mechanics](#quantum_mechanics) estimations.
- If $\Delta H_f^\circ < 0$, formation releases heat; if $> 0$, the compound is higher in energy than its constituent elements.
