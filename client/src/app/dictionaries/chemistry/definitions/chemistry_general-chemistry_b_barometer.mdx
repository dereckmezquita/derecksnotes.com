<a id="barometer">Barometer</a> - An **instrument** measuring **atmospheric pressure**. Traditionally, a mercury-filled tube in which external air pressure supports a column of mercury.

- The height of mercury correlates directly to atmospheric pressure.
- Helps interpret how [boiling_point](#boiling_point) changes with altitude or weather variations.
- In partial-pressure contexts ([daltons_law](#daltons_law)), knowledge of the barometric pressure is crucial for calculating total or [gas_law](#gas_law) relationships.
- Distinct from [gauge_pressure](#gauge_pressure), which measures relative to ambient pressure.

<Alert type='note'>
Mercury barometers set a historical standard for measuring absolute pressure. Modern digital barometers rely on sensor-based technology but functionally do the same job.
