<a id="acetate">Acetate</a> - The conjugate base of acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH), represented as CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup>. It arises when an [Arrhenius Acid](#arrhenius_acid) (like acetic acid) donates a proton. Acetates are versatile in chemistry:

1. **Buffering capacity**: Acetate solutions can act as buffers when combined with acetic acid, helping to stabilise pH.
2. **Coordination complexes**: Metal acetates are common in both laboratory reagents and biological systems.
3. **Biochemical significance**: In cellular metabolism, acetyl-CoA contains an acetyl group, functionally related to acetate.

**Chemical reaction**:  
When acetic acid deprotonates,

$$
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \; \rightleftharpoons \; \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}^+
$$

Because acetate can sometimes accept a proton under specific conditions, it exhibits limited [amphoteric](#amphoteric) behaviour in special contexts.
