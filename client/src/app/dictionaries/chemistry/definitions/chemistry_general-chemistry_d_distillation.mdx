<a id="distillation">Distillation</a> - A **separation technique** where a **liquid** is **vaporised**, then **condensed** to isolate it from other components. Common for purifying mixtures or obtaining solvents.

- **Steps**: Heat the mixture to its [boiling_point](#boiling_point); vapor passes into a condenser; purified distillate is collected.
- **Variations**:
  - Simple Distillation: Large boiling differences.
  - Fractional Distillation: Closer boiling ranges, often for [binary_mixture](#binary_mixture)s or complex solutions.
  - Steam Distillation: Employing steam to reduce partial pressures for heat-labile substances.
- Contrasts with [decantation](#decantation) which separates phases without boiling.
- [colligative_properties](#colligative_properties) can shift boiling behaviour, important in many distillation processes.

<Alert type='note'>
Distillation is fundamental in petrochemical refinement, alcoholic beverage production, and lab-scale solvent recovery.
