<a id="mass_number">Mass Number</a> - Symbolised as $A$, the **sum** of **protons** and **neutrons** in an atomic nucleus. Distinguishes [isotope](#isotope) species of the same element with different neutron counts.

- Not to be confused with the [atomic_number](#atomic_number) $Z$ (proton count).
- Example: Carbon-14 has $A = 14$ ($6$ protons, $8$ neutrons).
- Variation in $A$ can lead to differences in [mass_defect](#mass_defect) and nuclear stability; some undergo [beta_decay](#beta_decay).

<Alert type='note'>
Nuclear notation often appears as $^{A}_{Z}\mathrm{X}$, where $A$ is the mass number and $Z$ is the atomic number.
