<a id="kinetic_molecular_theory">Kinetic Molecular Theory</a> - A **conceptual framework** describing **gas behaviour** through **molecular motion**. Assumptions:

1. Gas particles have negligible volume (point masses).  
2. No intermolecular forces, only elastic collisions.  
3. Average kinetic energy depends solely on [temperature](#temperature).  
4. Molecular collisions are frequent, random, and explained by [collision_theory](#collision_theory).

- Ties to the [ideal_gas](#ideal_gas) model.  
- Explains diffusion, effusion, pressure, and energy distributions.  
- Temperature-entropy link: As $T$ rises, molecular speeds spread, affecting [entropy](#entropy).

<Alert type='note'>
Though approximate, kinetic molecular theory underlies basic gas laws, elucidating how volume, temperature, and pressure interconnect.
