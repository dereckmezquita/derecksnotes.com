<a id="halogenation">Halogenation</a> - A **reaction** in which **one or more** hydrogen atoms in an organic molecule are replaced by **halogen** atoms (F, Cl, Br, I). Mechanistically, this can proceed via **free-radical**, electrophilic, or nucleophilic substitution routes:

- **Free-Radical Halogenation**: Initiation, propagation, termination steps (tie to [free_radical](#free_radical)).
- **Electrophilic Halogenation**: Typically with aromatic rings, forming a new [covalent_bond](#covalent_bond).
- **Energy Considerations**: The required activation and reaction [enthalpy](#enthalpy) often rely on bond strengths. 
- **Reaction Rate**: [collision_theory](#collision_theory) says more collisions at higher temperature or concentration lead to faster halogenation.
