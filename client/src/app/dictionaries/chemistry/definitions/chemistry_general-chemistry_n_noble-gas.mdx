<a id="noble_gas">Noble Gas</a> - Elements in Group 18 (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn) with complete outer [electron_configuration](#electron_configuration)s, exhibiting extreme chemical stability.

- Demonstrates [periodicity](#periodicity) in physical properties.
- Highest [ionization_energy](#ionization_energy) in their periods.
- Full octet of [valence_electron](#valence_electron)s (except He with 2).
- Some form compounds under extreme conditions (mainly Xe, Kr).

<Alert type='note'>
Noble gas configuration stability explains why other elements tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve similar arrangements.
