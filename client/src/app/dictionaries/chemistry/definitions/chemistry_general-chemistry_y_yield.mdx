<a id="yield">Yield</a> - Amount of product obtained from chemical reaction. Usually expressed as percentage of [theoretical_yield](#theoretical_yield).

Calculation:
$$
\text{Percent yield} = \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical yield}} \times 100\%
$$

Factors affecting yield:
- Side reactions
- Reversible reactions
- [limiting_reagent](#limiting_reagent)
- Physical losses

[stoichiometry](#stoichiometry) guides yield prediction.
