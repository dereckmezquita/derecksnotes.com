<a id="lattice_energy">Lattice Energy</a> - The **energy released** when **gaseous ions** combine to form an **ionic solid**, or equivalently, the **energy required** to break the ionic crystal into its constituent ions. 

- Often estimated using [coulombs_law](#coulombs_law) based frameworks, though real ions have finite sizes and polarisation effects.
- Appears in the [born-haber-cycle](#born_haber_cycle), connecting ion formation, electron affinities, and [enthalpy](#enthalpy) changes.
- Higher lattice energy usually indicates a stronger [ionic_bond](#ionic_bond), leading to higher melting points and lower solubility in some solvents.

<Alert type='note'>
Lattice energy trends help rationalise why smaller ions with higher charges tend to form more stable, less soluble ionic crystals.
