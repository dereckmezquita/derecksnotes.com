<a id="emulsion">Emulsion</a> - A **mixture** of **two immiscible liquids**, where one is dispersed in the other as tiny droplets. Surfactants help stabilise the interface.

- Examples: Milk (fat droplets in water), mayonnaise (oil in water).
- Physical separations like [decantation](#decantation) or [distillation](#distillation) can be problematic if droplets don't easily coalesce.
- Concentrations or molecular counts use the [avogadro_constant](#avogadro_constant) for thorough analysis.
- The heat changes or [enthalpy](#enthalpy) of emulsification can matter in industrial processes.
