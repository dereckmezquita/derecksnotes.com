<a id="atomic_mass">Atomic Mass</a> - The mass of a single atom of a chemical element, often expressed in atomic mass units (u). One atomic mass unit is defined as **1/12** of the mass of a carbon-12 (C<sup>12</sup>) atom. Key notes:

- **Weighted average**: An element's listed atomic mass on the periodic table is typically the weighted average of its naturally occurring isotopes.
- **Mole concept**: [Avogadro's Constant](#avogadro_constant) links atomic mass to macroscopic quantities.

For illustation, if an element X has two isotopes:
- X<sub>1</sub> (mass = 10 u, abundance = 20%)  
- X<sub>2</sub> (mass = 11 u, abundance = 80%)  

Then average atomic mass:

$$
\text{Avg mass} = 0.20 \times 10 \;+\; 0.80 \times 11 = 10.8 \;\text{u}
$$

Compare [atomic-number](#atomic_number), which simply counts protons without reference to mass.
