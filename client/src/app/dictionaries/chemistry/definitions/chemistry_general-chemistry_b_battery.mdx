<a id="battery">Battery</a> - A device that **converts chemical energy** into **electrical energy** via one or more **electrochemical cells**. Each cell typically has a positive and negative electrode separated by an electrolyte.

- **Operating Principle**: Spontaneous redox reactions drive current flow, measured in [ampere](#ampere).
- **Types**: Primary (non-rechargeable), secondary (rechargeable) cells.
- **Thermodynamics**: Reaction [enthalpy](#enthalpy) and free energy changes link to cell potentials. For instance, [electrode_potential](#electrode_potential) values help predict voltage.
- **Applications**: Portable electronics, automotive batteries, large-scale energy storage.
