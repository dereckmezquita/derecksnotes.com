<a id="work">Work</a> - Energy transfer through force over distance. Important in [thermodynamics](#thermodynamics) and [energy](#energy) calculations.

Types and equations:
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{PV work: } w &= -P\Delta V \\
\text{Electrical: } w &= nFE_\text{cell} \\
\text{Surface: } w &= \gamma\Delta A
\end{align*}
$$

Sign convention:
- Positive: work done on system
- Negative: work done by system
