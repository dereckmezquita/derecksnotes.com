<a id="diffusion">Diffusion</a> - The **net movement** of particles from an area of **higher concentration** to **lower concentration**, driven by random molecular motion.

Fick's first law:
$$
J = -D \frac{dC}{dx}
$$
where:
- $J$ is flux,
- $D$ is the diffusion coefficient,
- $dC/dx$ is the concentration gradient.

- [collision_theory](#collision_theory) underlies the random collisions leading to net flux.
- Affects solutions or gases obeying [gas_law](#gas_law) expansions or partial mixing. 
- Spreads out [concentration](#concentration) gradients, often increasing [entropy](#entropy).

<Alert type='note'>
Diffusion explains everyday processes like aroma dispersal, ink spreading in water, or gas mixing in the atmosphere.
