<a id="electrode_potential">Electrode Potential</a> - The **voltage** associated with an **electrode**, measured relative to a reference (e.g. the Standard Hydrogen Electrode). It indicates how readily a species is oxidised or reduced at that electrode surface.

Electrode potentials connect thermodynamics and electron flow: $ \Delta G $ (Gibbs free energy) relates to $E$ (potential), and factors like [enthalpy](#enthalpy) and entropy can shift equilibria. In [electrochemistry](#electrochemistry) or [electrolysis](#electrolysis) cells, electrode potentials determine which half-reactions dominate. Under certain conditions, water's [autoionization](#autoionization) may also influence the local potential by altering pH.

$$
\Delta G = -nFE

- $n$: Moles of electrons
- $F$: Faraday constant
- $E$: Electrode potential
