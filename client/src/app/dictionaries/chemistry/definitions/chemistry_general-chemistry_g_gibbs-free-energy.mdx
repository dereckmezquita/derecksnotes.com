<a id="gibbs_free_energy">Gibbs Free Energy</a> - Denoted $G$, a **thermodynamic potential** that predicts **spontaneity** at constant pressure and temperature:

$$
G = H - T S
$$

- $H$: [enthalpy](#enthalpy)
- $T$: Temperature (kelvin)
- $S$: [entropy](#entropy)

A negative $\Delta G$ indicates a spontaneous process. In [electrochemistry](#electrochemistry), $\Delta G$ ties to cell potentials; at [chemical_equilibrium](#chemical_equilibrium), $\Delta G = 0$.

<Alert type='important'>
Because $G$ merges enthalpy and entropy, it offers a concise measure for whether a reaction can proceed on its own under given conditions.
