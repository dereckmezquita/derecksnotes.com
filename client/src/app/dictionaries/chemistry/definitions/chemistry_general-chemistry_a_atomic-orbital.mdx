<a id="atomic_orbital">Atomic Orbital</a> - A mathematical function describing the **probability distribution** of an electron around an atom's nucleus. Designated by quantum numbers (n, l, m, s), common orbital types are *s*, *p*, *d*, and *f*:

- **s-orbitals**: Spherical symmetry around the nucleus.
- **p-orbitals**: Dumbbell-shaped, oriented along x, y, or z axes.
- **d-orbitals**: More complex shapes (clover leaves, doughnuts).

Their shapes underlie bonding, reactivity, and the formation of various [allotropes](#allotrope). Knowledge of the [atomic number](#atomic_number) helps determine electron configuration, influencing how these orbitals are filled.
