<a id="nucleus">Nucleus</a> - The dense central region of an atom containing protons and neutrons, determining the element's [atomic_number](#atomic_number) and [mass_number](#mass_number).

- Comprises >99.9% of atomic mass in < 0.01% of volume.
- [nuclear_stability](#nuclear_stability) depends on proton/neutron ratio.
- Held together by strong nuclear force and [binding_energy](#binding_energy).
- Size roughly proportional to cube root of mass number.

<Alert type='note'>
Nuclear radius is about 10⁻¹⁵ m (fermi), vastly smaller than atomic radius (~10⁻¹⁰ m).
