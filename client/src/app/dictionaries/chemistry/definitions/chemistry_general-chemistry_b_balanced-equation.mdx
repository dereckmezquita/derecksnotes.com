<a id="balanced_equation">Balanced Equation</a> - A chemical equation in which the **number of atoms** of each element is the **same** on both sides of the arrow, preserving **mass** and **charge** (when relevant). For example:

$$
\text{CH}_4 + 2\,\text{O}_2 \;\to\; \text{CO}_2 + 2\,\text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

- Ensures stoichiometric integrity: Using [avogadro_constant](#avogadro_constant), we can scale microscopic particles to macroscopic amounts.
- Reactant and product coefficients must reflect actual mole ratios, which influences reaction [enthalpy](#enthalpy) calculations.
- [collision_theory](#collision_theory) explains how correct proportions of reactants can affect reaction rates.
- Nuclear equations (e.g. [beta_decay](#beta_decay)) also require balancing nucleons and charge, though the rules differ slightly from typical chemical equations.

<Alert type='note'>
Balancing is an essential step in quantitative chemistry, ensuring correct reactant-product relationships for further calculations.
