<a id="fahrenheit_scale">Fahrenheit Scale</a> - A temperature scale developed by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. It sets 32°F as the freezing point of water and 212°F as the boiling point (at sea level). Converting from Celsius ($^\circ\mathrm{C}$) involves:
$$
T_{\mathrm{F}} = \frac{9}{5} \times T_{\mathrm{C}} + 32
$$

- Primarily used in a few countries (e.g. United States).
- In scientific contexts, the Kelvin or Celsius scales are more common (see [charles_law](#charles_law)).
- Thermal properties like [enthalpy](#enthalpy) changes can be tabulated in °C or K, so the Fahrenheit scale is often converted for consistency.
- The difference between 32°F and 212°F parallels the 100° difference between 0°C and 100°C, used in the [boiling-point](#boiling_point) references at sea level.
