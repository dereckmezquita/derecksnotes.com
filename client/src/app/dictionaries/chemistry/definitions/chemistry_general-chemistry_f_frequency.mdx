<a id="frequency">Frequency</a> - The **number of waves** (oscillations) per **second**, measured in hertz (Hz). In chemistry, it often appears in **spectroscopy** or reaction rate discussions.

- Wave relation:  
  $$ 
  c = \lambda \,\nu 
  $$
  where $c$ is the speed of light, $\lambda$ is wavelength, and $\nu$ is frequency.
- Spectral Lines: [bohr_model](#bohr_model) suggests discrete electronic transitions with specific frequencies or energies. This underpins [fluorescence](#fluorescence) and absorption.
- Quantum mechanical context ([quantum_mechanics](#quantum_mechanics)): Photons carry energy $E = h\,\nu$, crucial for bond excitation or cleavage.
- Macroscopic rates: [collision-theory](#collision_theory) sometimes references collision frequency among molecules in a gas.
