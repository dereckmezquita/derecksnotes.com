<a id="electron_affinity">Electron Affinity</a> - The **energy change** when a **neutral atom** (gas-phase) **gains an electron** to form a negatively charged ion. It reflects how strongly the atom 'pulls in' an added electron.

Exothermic in many non-metals, especially halogens, but sometimes endothermic in metals with electron-repulsion concerns. This property complements [ionisation_energy](#ionisation_energy), and arises from [quantum_mechanics](#quantum_mechanics) descriptions of orbital occupancy. Industrial processes using [electrochemistry](#electrochemistry) often leverage differences in electron affinities when separating elements. Data in tables can be converted to per-mole terms using the [avogadro_constant](#avogadro_constant).
