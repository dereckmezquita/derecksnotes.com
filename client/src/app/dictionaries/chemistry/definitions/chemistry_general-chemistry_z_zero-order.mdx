<a id="zero_order">Zero Order</a> - Reaction where [reaction_rate](#reaction_rate) is independent of reactant concentration. Common in surface-limited reactions.

Integrated [rate_law](#rate_law):
$$
[A]_t = [A]_0 - kt
$$

Key features:
- Linear concentration decay
- [half_life](#half_life): t½ = [A]₀/2k
- Rate constant units: M·s⁻¹
- Surface-saturated [reaction_mechanism](#reaction_mechanism)s

Examples:
- Photochemical decomposition
- Enzyme saturation kinetics
- Surface catalysis
