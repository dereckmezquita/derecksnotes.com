<a id="deposition">Deposition</a> - A **phase transition** where a **gas** transforms **directly** into a **solid**, **skipping** the liquid phase (opposite of [sublimation](#sublimation)).

- Example: Frost forming from water vapour.
- Usually exothermic; energy is released as the vapour molecules lock into a solid lattice, relevant to [enthalpy](#enthalpy) measurements.
- The drop in molecular randomness also affects [entropy](#entropy).
- [calorimetry](#calorimetry) can track heat flow during deposition for thermodynamic data.

<Alert type='note'>
Deposition is employed in thin film technologies, depositing layers of material from vapour for semiconductors or optical coatings.
