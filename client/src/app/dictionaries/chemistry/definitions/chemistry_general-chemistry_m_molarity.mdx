<a id="molarity">Molarity</a> - A **measure** of **concentration** denoted **M**, defined as **moles of solute** per **litre of solution**:

$$
\mathrm{Molarity} = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{litres of solution}}
$$

- Relates to [colligative_properties](#colligative_properties) calculations (e.g. boiling-point elevation, freezing-point depression).
- Ties with [avogadro_constant](#avogadro_constant) to switch between mole-based and particle-based counts.
- Variation from other [concentration](#concentration) units like molality, mass percent, or normality.
- In preparing [solutions](#solutions), molarity is standard for stoichiometric calculations.

<Alert type='note'>
Molarity is temperature-dependent since the solution volume changes with temperature, affecting the final concentration.
