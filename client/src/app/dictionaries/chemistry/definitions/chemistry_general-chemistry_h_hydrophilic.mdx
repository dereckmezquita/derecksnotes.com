<a id="hydrophilic">Hydrophilic</a> - Describes a **substance** or **functional group** that is **water-attracting** or **water-soluble**. Hydrophilic substances typically form hydrogen bonds or strong dipole interactions with water.

- Examples: Polar head groups in surfactants, sugar molecules, certain amino-acid side chains.
- Contrasts with hydrophobic (water-repelling) segments in an [emulsion](#emulsion).
- [hydration](#hydration) stabilises these species in aqueous solutions, influencing [concentration](#concentration) equilibria.
- Even [amphoteric](#amphoteric) molecules can exhibit both hydrophilic (polar) and hydrophobic regions.

<Alert type='note'>
Hydrophilic interactions underpin biological membrane assembly, protein folding, and colloidal stability in water.
