<a id="ammonium">Ammonium</a> - The cation NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, formed by protonation of [ammonia](#ammonia). It often acts as a **conjugate acid** in acid-base equilibria.

Ammonium is characterised by several key features:

- **Acidic Tendency**: In the [Arrhenius-acid](#arrhenius_acid) sense, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> can donate a proton to water, albeit weakly.
- **Biological Significance**: Excess ammonium in organisms must be detoxified (e.g. urea cycle in humans).
- **Ammonium Salts**: Common in fertilisers (e.g. ammonium nitrate, NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>).

$$
\text{NH}_4^+ \;\rightleftharpoons\; \text{NH}_3 + \text{H}^+
$$

Small but crucial shifts in this equilibrium can have significant effects on soil pH and metabolic pathways.
