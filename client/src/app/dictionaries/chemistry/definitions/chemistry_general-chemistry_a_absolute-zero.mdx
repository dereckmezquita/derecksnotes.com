<a id="absolute_zero">Absolute Zero</a> - The theoretical **lowest possible temperature**, defined as 0 K (kelvins) or -273.15 Â°C. At absolute zero, a system is thought to have **minimum internal energy**, with virtually all molecular motion ceasing (in classical conceptions).

The concept of absolute zero has far-reaching implications in various fields:

1. **Thermodynamics**: Foundational reference point; all kelvin-based temperature scales revolve around absolute zero.
2. **Entropy**: According to the third law of thermodynamics, a perfect crystal at absolute zero would have zero entropy.
3. **Quantum effects**: Real quantum systems still retain zero-point energy even at 0 K.

$$
\text{Temperature range: } T \ge 0 \,\text{K}
$$

In practical applications (e.g. cryogenics, superconductors), we never truly reach absolute zero, but we approach it. The interplay of [activation-energy](#activation_energy) for chemical reactions at near-zero temperatures becomes extremely limited, and even [arrhenius-base](#arrhenius_base) definitions can change in exotic states of matter. For mole-based calculations, [avogadro-constant](#avogadro_constant) remains relevant even in cryogenic realms.
