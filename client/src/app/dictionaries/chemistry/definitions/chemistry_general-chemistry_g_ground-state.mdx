<a id="ground_state">Ground State</a> - The **lowest-energy** electronic configuration for an atom, ion, or molecule. Electrons occupy **orbitals** based on minimised energy according to the Pauli exclusion principle and Hund's rule.

- Contrasts with **excited states**, which have higher energy.
- [bohr_model](#bohr_model) introduced the concept for hydrogen, refined by modern [quantum_mechanics](#quantum_mechanics).
- Ion formation or [ionisation_energy](#ionisation_energy) considerations start from the ground-state arrangement.
- In molecules, partial [delocalization](#delocalization) of electrons can define a more stable ground state with lower overall energy.

<Alert type='important'>
Most physical and chemical behaviour references the ground state, as excited states are often fleeting or need energy input.
