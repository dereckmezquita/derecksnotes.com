<a id="london_dispersion_forces">London Dispersion Forces</a> - **Weak** [intermolecular_forces](#intermolecular_forces) arising from **temporary dipoles** induced by **electron cloud fluctuations**. Present in **all molecules**, but crucial in **nonpolar** substances.

- Depend on [polarizability](#polarizability): large or elongated electron clouds can form stronger instantaneous dipoles.
- Influence [boiling_point](#boiling_point) trends (e.g., heavier alkane = stronger dispersion = higher b.p.).
- Contribute to the overall [entropy](#entropy) interplay in condensed phases, though subtle.

<Alert type='note'>
London dispersion forces help explain how noble gases can liquefy at low temperatures and why large nonpolar molecules have elevated boiling points.
