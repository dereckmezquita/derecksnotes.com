<a id="inversion_centre">Inversion Centre</a> - A **symmetry element** in a molecule or crystal that **inverts** every point through a central location. If a molecule has an **inversion centre**, each point $(x, y, z)$ has an equivalent counterpart at $(-x, -y, -z)$ relative to that centre.

- Common in certain [coordination_chemistry](#coordination_chemistry) complexes or extended lattices.
- Electronic [delocalization](#delocalization) patterns can reflect inversion symmetry (or lack thereof).
- [quantum_mechanics](#quantum_mechanics) shows that inversion-symmetric wavefunctions can be even or odd with respect to the centre.

<Alert type='important'>
Inversion symmetry influences selection rules in spectroscopy (transitions may be forbidden or allowed depending on parity).
