<a id="neutralization">Neutralization</a> - A chemical reaction between an [acid_base](#acid_base) pair producing water and a salt, typically resulting in a neutral [pH](#pH):

$$
\text{Acid} + \text{Base} \rightarrow \text{Salt} + \text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

- Results in [salt_formation](#salt_formation) through ionic combination.
- Involves consumption of [hydronium_ion](#hydronium_ion)s and hydroxide ions.
- Often exothermic, releasing heat energy.
- Used in analytical chemistry for titrations.

<Alert type='note'>
Complete neutralization doesn't always result in pH 7, as some salts undergo hydrolysis affecting final pH.
