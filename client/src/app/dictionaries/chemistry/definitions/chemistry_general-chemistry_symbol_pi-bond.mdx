<a id="pi_bond">π-Bond</a> - Covalent bond formed by parallel [orbital_overlap](#orbital_overlap) of p orbitals. Key in multiple bonds.

Characteristics:
- Side-to-side overlap
- Electron density above/below axis
- Weaker than σ bonds
- Free rotation blocked

Common in:
- C=C [double_bond](#double_bond)s
- Aromatics
- Conjugated systems
- [molecular_orbital](#molecular_orbital) theory
