<a id="line_spectrum">Line Spectrum</a> - A **discrete set** of **wavelengths** or **frequencies** emitted (or absorbed) by **atoms** or **molecules**. Each line correlates to an **electronic transition** between [energy_level](#energy_level)s.

- **Atom-specific**: E.g. hydrogen's [balmer_series](#balmer_series) lines.
- Supported historically by the [bohr_model](#bohr_model), refined by modern [quantum_mechanics](#quantum_mechanics).
- Distinct from a continuous spectrum; each line indicates a well-defined energy difference.

<Alert type='note'>
Line spectra confirm quantised energy states, vital evidence for the waveâ€“particle dual nature of electrons.
