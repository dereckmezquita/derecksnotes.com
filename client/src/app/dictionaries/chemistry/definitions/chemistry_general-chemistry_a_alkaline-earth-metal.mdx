<a id="alkaline_earth_metal">Alkaline Earth Metal</a> - The elements in **Group 2** of the periodic table: Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, and Ra. Key traits include:
- Two valence electrons, contributing to their reactivity
- Formation of oxides with the generic formula MO (where M = metal)
- Less reactive than [alkali metals](#alkali_metal), but still form hydroxides and other alkaline compounds

**Common example**: Calcium reacting with water:

$$
\text{Ca} + 2\,\text{H}_2\text{O} \;\to\; \text{Ca(OH)}_2 + \text{H}_2\uparrow
$$

Their name stems from the fact that their oxides and hydroxides were once known as “earths” and exhibit basic (alkaline) properties in solution.
