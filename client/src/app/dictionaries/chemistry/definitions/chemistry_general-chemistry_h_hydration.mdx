<a id="hydration">Hydration</a> - The process by which **water molecules** **surround** and interact with **solute particles** (ions or molecules). Hydration is a specific form of [solvation](#solvation) focusing on water as the solvent.

- **Ionic Solutes**: Water dipoles orient around ions, stabilising the solution. 
- **Polar Molecules**: Hydrogen bonding can drive hydration.  
- **Thermodynamics**: [enthalpy](#enthalpy) may be exothermic or endothermic, and [entropy](#entropy) considerations track how water structuring changes.  
- **Acid-Base**: Even [amphoteric](#amphoteric) species rely on hydration shells influencing proton availability.
