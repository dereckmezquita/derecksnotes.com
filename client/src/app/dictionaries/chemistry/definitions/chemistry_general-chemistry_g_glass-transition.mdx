<a id="glass_transition">Glass Transition</a> - A **pseudo-phase transition** where an **amorphous** material (e.g. certain polymers, glass) shifts from a **brittle 'glassy' state** to a **rubbery or viscous** state. Unlike a sharp melting point, this transition covers a temperature range.

- Typically analysed with [calorimetry](#calorimetry), detecting changes in heat capacity.
- Involves subtle rearrangements of molecular segments, affecting [enthalpy](#enthalpy) and [entropy](#entropy).
- No distinct crystalline structure, so the transition is gradual.

<Alert type='warning'>
Glass-transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) is not a strict thermodynamic phase transition; it's an empirical threshold where mobility changes markedly.
