<a id="micelle">Micelle</a> - A **supramolecular assembly** of **amphiphilic** molecules in water or other solvents. Hydrophobic 'tails' cluster inward, while hydrophilic 'heads' face the solvent.

- Enables solubilisation of nonpolar substances in water (detergents or surfactants).
- Contrasts with an [emulsion](#emulsion) where discrete droplets form. 
- Reduces [surface_tension](#surface_tension) by orienting [amphiphile](#amphiphile) heads outward, [hydrophobic](#hydrophobic) tails inward.

<Alert type='note'>
Micelles are pivotal in cleaning, emulsifying, and delivering hydrophobic drugs or nutrients in aqueous environments.
