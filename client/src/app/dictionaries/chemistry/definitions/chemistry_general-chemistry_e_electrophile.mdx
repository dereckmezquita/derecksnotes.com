<a id="electrophile">Electrophile</a> - Any **electron-poor** species that **accepts** a pair of electrons to form a bond. Akin to a Lewis acid or [arrhenius_acid](#arrhenius_acid), but broader in scope.

- Typical examples: $ \text{H}^+, \text{NO}_2^+, \text{BF}_3 $.
- Often reacts with a [nucleophile](#nucleophile) by forming a [covalent_bond](#covalent_bond) through electron-pair donation.
- Rate of electrophilic reactions can depend on [collision_theory](#collision_theory), since higher temperature or concentration fosters more collisions.
