<a id="limiting_reactant">Limiting Reactant</a> - The **reactant** that is **fully consumed** first in a reaction, thus **determining** the maximum amount of **product** formed. Any other reactants are in **excess**.

- Found by comparing stoichiometric ratios in the [balanced_equation](#balanced_equation) with actual amounts available.
- Mass or moles can be converted using the [avogadro_constant](#avogadro_constant) if needed.
- Once consumed, reaction halts, capping theoretical [yield](#yield).
- The leftover [excess-reactant](#excess_reactant) remains unreacted.

<Alert type='note'>
Correctly identifying the limiting reactant is essential for accurate product predictions and resource optimisation.
