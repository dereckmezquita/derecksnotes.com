<a id="amalgam">Amalgam</a> - An **alloy** in which **mercury** is a significant component, often combined with metals such as silver, tin, or gold. Traditionally used in dental fillings, though usage has declined due to mercury toxicity concerns.

Amalgams exhibit several key features:

- **Formation**: Mercury dissolves or reacts with metal surfaces, creating metal-mercury bonds.
- **Physical Properties**: Amalgams can be soft, brittle, or hard, depending on the composition.
- **Chemistry Context**: Mercury's unique liquid state at room temperature influences the [activation-energy](#activation_energy) of certain reactions; also, elemental mercury is an interesting [allotrope](#allotrope) candidate in discussions of phase transitions.

In some amalgams, electronegative metals form stable [anion](#anion)-like species within the mercury matrix, highlighting complex redox interactions.
