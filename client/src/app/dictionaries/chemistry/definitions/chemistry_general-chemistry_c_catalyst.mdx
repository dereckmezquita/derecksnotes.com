<a id="catalyst">Catalyst</a> - A **substance** that **increases** the rate of a reaction by **lowering** its [activation_energy](#activation_energy), without being consumed in the process. Catalysts can be solids (e.g. metals), liquids, or enzymes in biochemistry.

- **Mechanism**: Alters reaction pathway, enabling more molecules to surpass the energy barrier.  
- **Selectivity**: Some catalysts favour specific products, crucial in industrial syntheses.  
- **Coordination-based**: In [coordination_chemistry](#coordination_chemistry), metal complexes may provide unique active sites.  
- **Chemical Bonds**: Temporary [covalent_bond](#covalent_bond) formation between catalyst and substrate can facilitate reaction steps.  
- **Kinetic Impact**: By [collision_theory](#collision_theory), more effective collisions occur with a catalyst.

<Alert type='note'>
Catalysts are indispensable in chemical manufacturing for efficiency, cost-saving, and minimising environmental impact.
