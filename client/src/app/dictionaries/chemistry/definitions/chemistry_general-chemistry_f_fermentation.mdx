<a id="fermentation">Fermentation</a> - An **anaerobic** biochemical process in which microorganisms (often yeasts or bacteria) convert sugars to other products (e.g. ethanol, lactic acid) in the absence of oxygen.

- Key for producing alcoholic beverages, bread, yoghurts.
- Enzyme-driven pathways alter the [enthalpy](#enthalpy) balance, generating less energy per glucose unit than full oxidation but sufficient for microbial survival.
- Different microorganisms or conditions lead to varied end products: ethanol, lactate, or mixed acids.
- Proton transfers and [autoprotolysis](#autoprotolysis)-like steps can occur in the medium's water. [Amino_acid](#amino_acid) composition and [electronegativity](#electronegativity) differences in co-factors also affect enzymatic reactivity.
