<a id="geiger_counter">Geiger Counter</a> - An **instrument** used to **detect** and **measure** ionising radiation, especially **alpha** and **beta** particles. It consists of a gas-filled tube and electrodes, producing a pulse when radiation ionises the gas.

- Connected to [beta_decay](#beta_decay) detection and nuclear [fission](#fission) studies.
- Ion-pair creation in the tube correlates to charged particle flux, somewhat reminiscent of [collision_theory](#collision_theory).
- Electrostatic interactions ([coulombs_law](#coulombs_law)) cause gas ionisation to trigger an avalanche discharge, counted as 'clicks'.

<Alert type='note'>
A Geiger-MÃ¼ller tube requires relatively low voltage to operate and is popular for quick radioactive surveys.
