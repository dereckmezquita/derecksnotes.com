<a id="maxwell_boltzmann_distribution">Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution</a> - A **statistical function** describing the **speeds** (or energies) of gas particles at a given [temperature](#temperature). 

- Shows that most molecules have a moderate speed, with fewer having very low or very high speeds.
- Underpins [kinetic_molecular_theory](#kinetic_molecular_theory) and [collision_theory](#collision_theory).
- Ties to [gas_law](#gas_law) predictions, as average speeds scale with temperature.
- Typically plotted as a frequency vs. speed curve, shifting to higher speeds and broader distribution at higher temperatures.

<Alert type='note'>
This distribution is crucial for understanding how only a fraction of molecules exceed the activation threshold in chemical reactions.
