<a id="alcohol">Alcohol</a> - Any **organic compound** bearing one or more hydroxyl (-OH) groups attached to a carbon skeleton. Common examples include methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) and ethanol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH).

Alcohols exhibit several key properties:

- **Polarity**: The OH group confers hydrogen-bonding capacity, affecting solubility in water.  
- **Boiling Point**: Tends to be higher than that of corresponding hydrocarbons due to hydrogen bonding.  
- **Oxidation**: Primary alcohols can oxidise to [aldehydes](#aldehyde) and then further to carboxylic acids.

**Azeotropic Behaviour**: some **binary mixtures** of alcohols (e.g. ethanol-water) form an [azeotrope](#azeotrope), complicating simple distillation.

$$
\text{General form: } \mathrm{C}_n \mathrm{H}_{2n+2 - x} \mathrm{O}, \text{ where } x \ge 0 \text{ for double bonds/rings}
$$

where:
- $ n $ is the number of carbon atoms
- $ x $ is the number of unsaturations

Under strongly acidic ([arrhenius-acid](#arrhenius_acid)) conditions, certain alcohols dehydrate to form alkenes or ethers.
