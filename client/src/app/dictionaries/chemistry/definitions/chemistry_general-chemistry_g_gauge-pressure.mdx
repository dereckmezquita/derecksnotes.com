<a id="gauge_pressure">Gauge Pressure</a> - The **pressure** measured **relative** to the surrounding **atmospheric pressure**. So if atmospheric pressure is 1 atm, a gauge reading of 2 atm means an **absolute** pressure of 3 atm.

Often used in **pressurised systems** (e.g. gas cylinders, tyre pressures). For reference, a [barometer](#barometer) measures **absolute** atmospheric pressure, which can influence the [boiling_point](#boiling_point) or volume expansions under [gas_law](#gas_law).
