<a id="non-euclidean-geometry">Non-Euclidean Geometry</a> - In **geometry**, **non-Euclidean geometry** refers to either hyperbolic or elliptic geometry (or others) that reject or modify Euclid’s fifth postulate (the parallel postulate). 

**Key points**:
- **Hyperbolic geometry**: infinite lines diverge more rapidly, sums of angles in triangles are < 180°.
- **Elliptic geometry**: lines “curve,” angles in triangles sum to > 180°.

No standard R demonstration, but we might explore transformations or plots for illustrative geometry.
