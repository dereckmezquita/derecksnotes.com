<a id="k-means">K-means</a> - In **cluster analysis**, **k-means** is an algorithm that partitions $n$ observations into $k$ clusters. Each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centre). 

**Algorithm Outline**:
1. Choose $k$ initial centroids.
2. Assign each data point to its nearest centroid.
3. Recompute centroids as the mean of points in each cluster.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until assignments stabilize or a maximum iteration count is reached.

K-means often assumes data in a continuous space and can leverage knowledge of the [distribution](#distribution) of points to identify cluster structure.

**R demonstration** (basic example):


``` r
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)

set.seed(123)
dt_data <- data.table(
  x = rnorm(50, 5, 1),
  y = rnorm(50, 2, 1)
)
# Add another cluster
dt_data2 <- data.table(
  x = rnorm(50, 10, 1),
  y = rnorm(50, 7, 1)
)

dt_full <- rbind(dt_data, dt_data2)

# k-means with 2 clusters
res_km <- kmeans(dt_full[, .(x, y)], centers=2)

dt_full[, cluster := factor(res_km$cluster)]

ggplot(dt_full, aes(x=x, y=y, color=cluster)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title="k-means Clustering (k=2)",
    x="X",
    y="Y"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
