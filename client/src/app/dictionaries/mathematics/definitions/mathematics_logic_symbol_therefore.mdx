<a id="therefore">∴ (Therefore)</a> - In **logic** and mathematical writing, **∴** (“therefore”) is used to conclude a proof or a chain of reasoning. Often follows from statements involving [forall](#forall), [exists](#exists), or other logical premises.

Example usage:

'59270'
\forall x, P(x)\Rightarrow Q(x). \quad \therefore \forall x, Q(x).
'59270'

No direct R demonstration; it’s a symbolic punctuation in proofs.  

``` r
cat("∴ is used as 'Therefore', concluding a chain of logical or arithmetic steps.")
```

```
## ∴ is used as 'Therefore', concluding a chain of logical or arithmetic steps.
```
