<a id="radical">√ (Radical)</a> - The **radical** symbol √ indicates the principal square root of a number. More generally, radical notation can include indices for nth roots:

'59102'
\sqrt{x}, \quad \sqrt[n]{x}.
'59102'

**Key points**:
- For nonnegative x, √x is the nonnegative root.
- In advanced contexts, negative radicands lead to complex numbers.

**R demonstration** (square root in R):


``` r
library(data.table)

sqrt(16)  # returns 4
```

```
## [1] 4
```

``` r
sqrt(-1)  # NaN in real arithmetic
```

```
## Warning in sqrt(-1): NaNs produced
```

```
## [1] NaN
```
