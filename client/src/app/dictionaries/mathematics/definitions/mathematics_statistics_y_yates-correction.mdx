<a id="yates-correction">Yates' Correction</a> - In **statistics**, **Yates' correction** (also called **Yates' continuity correction**) is applied to a [chi-squared-test](#chi-squared-test) for 2Ã—2 contingency tables to reduce bias when sample sizes are small. It adjusts the observed frequencies before computing the chi-squared statistic:

$$
\chi^2 = \sum\frac{(|O - E| - 0.5)^2}{E}.
$$

**Key points**:
- Often recommended if expected frequencies are < 5, though its usage is debated.
- Under the [null-hypothesis](#null-hypothesis), the chi-squared distribution still approximates the test statistic.

No built-in function for Yates-correction in base R, but some `chisq.test` wrappers handle it, or you can manually apply the formula.


``` r
library(data.table)

# Example of manually applying Yates' correction (conceptual)
observed <- matrix(c(10,4,3,12), nrow=2)
expected <- rowSums(observed) %o% colSums(observed) / sum(observed)

chisq_yates <- sum((abs(observed - expected) - 0.5)^2 / expected)
chisq_yates
```
