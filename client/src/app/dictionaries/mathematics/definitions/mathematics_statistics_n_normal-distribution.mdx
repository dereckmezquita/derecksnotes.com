<a id="normal-distribution">Normal Distribution</a> - In **statistics**, the **normal distribution** (or Gaussian) is a continuous probability [distribution](#distribution) with probability density function:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\,\sigma} \exp\!\Bigl(-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\Bigr)
$$

where '56956'\mu'56956' is the [mean](#mean) and '56956'\sigma^2'56956' is the [variance](#variance).

**Key points**:
- Symmetric, bell-shaped curve.
- Many natural phenomena approximate normality by Central Limit Theorem arguments.

**R demonstration**:


``` r
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)

set.seed(123)
dt_norm <- data.table(x = rnorm(1000, mean=5, sd=2))

ggplot(dt_norm, aes(x=x)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=30, fill="lightblue", color="black", aes(y=..density..)) +
  geom_density(color="red", size=1) +
  labs(
    title="Normal Distribution Example",
    x="Value",
    y="Density"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
