<a id="injection">Injection</a> - In **functions** (set theory), an **injection** (or one-to-one function) is a function $f: A \to B$ such that different elements of $A$ always map to different elements of $B$. Formally:

$$
f(a_1) = f(a_2) \implies a_1 = a_2.
$$

**Key points**:
- No two distinct elements in $A$ share the same image in $B$.
- Contrasts with [surjection](#surjection) (onto) and [bijection](#bijection) (one-to-one and onto).

**R demonstration** (not typical, but we can check uniqueness in a numeric map):


``` r
library(data.table)

f_injective <- function(x) x^2  # for integers, watch out for collisions at +/-x
x_vals <- c(-2,-1,0,1,2)
f_vals <- f_injective(x_vals)
data.table(x=x_vals, f=f_vals)
```

```
##        x     f
##    <num> <num>
## 1:    -2     4
## 2:    -1     1
## 3:     0     0
## 4:     1     1
## 5:     2     4
```

``` r
# Notice that x^2 is not injective over all integers (f(-2)=f(2)). 
# But restricted to nonnegative x, it can be injective.
```
