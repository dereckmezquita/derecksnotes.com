<a id="null-hypothesis">Null Hypothesis</a> - In **statistics**, the **null hypothesis** (commonly denoted $H_0$) is a baseline assumption or “no change” scenario in [hypothesis-testing](#hypothesis-testing). Typically, $H_0$ states that there is no effect or no difference between groups.

**Key points**:
- We either “reject $H_0$” or “fail to reject $H_0$” based on data evidence.
- The alternative hypothesis $H_1$ or $H_a$ posits the effect or difference.

**R demonstration** (t-test example, focusing on $H_0$ that the population means are equal):


``` r
library(data.table)

set.seed(123)
dt_null <- data.table(
  groupA = rnorm(20, mean=5, sd=1),
  groupB = rnorm(20, mean=5.2, sd=1)
)

t_res <- t.test(dt_null$groupA, dt_null$groupB, var.equal=TRUE)
t_res
```

```
## 
## 	Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  dt_null$groupA and dt_null$groupB
## t = -0.0249, df = 38, p-value = 0.9803
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -0.5859110  0.5716729
## sample estimates:
## mean of x mean of y 
##  5.141624  5.148743
```
