<a id="manifold">Manifold</a> - In **topology** and differential geometry, a **manifold** is a [topological-space](#topological-space) that locally resembles Euclidean space. Formally, an $n$-dimensional manifold is a space where every point has a neighbourhood homeomorphic to \(\mathbb{R}^n\).

**Key points**:
- The concept of [dimension](#dimension) is central: a 2D manifold locally looks like a plane, a 3D manifold like space, etc.
- Smooth manifolds allow calculus-like operations on them.

No direct R demonstration, but we can illustrate how to store a “chart” or local coordinate system conceptually:


``` r
library(data.table)
cat("Manifolds are an advanced concept. In R, we'd handle geometry libraries for numeric solutions.")
```

```
