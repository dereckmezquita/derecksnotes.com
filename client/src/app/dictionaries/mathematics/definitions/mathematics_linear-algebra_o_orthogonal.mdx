<a id="orthogonal">Orthogonal</a> - In **linear algebra**, vectors (or subspaces) are **orthogonal** if their dot product is zero. A set of vectors is orthogonal if every pair of distinct vectors in the set is orthogonal. A [matrix](#matrix) is an orthogonal matrix if $Q^T Q = I$.

**Key points**:
- Orthogonality generalises the concept of perpendicularity in higher dimensions.
- Orthogonal transformations preserve lengths and angles.

**R demonstration** (check if a matrix is orthogonal):


``` r
library(data.table)

Q <- matrix(c(0,1, -1,0), nrow=2, byrow=TRUE)
# Q^T Q
test_orth <- t(Q) %*% Q
test_orth
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1    0
## [2,]    0    1
```

``` r
# If Q is orthogonal, test_orth should be the 2x2 identity.
```
