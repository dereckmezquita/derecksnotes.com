<a id="rational-number">Rational Number</a> - In **analysis/number theory**, a **rational number** is a number that can be expressed as a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ with integers $p$ and $q \neq 0$. The set of all rational numbers is typically denoted $\mathbb{Q}$.

**Key points**:
- Dense in the real line but countable.
- Opposite concept: irrational numbers (like $\sqrt{2}$ or $\pi$) cannot be written as a fraction of integers.

Minimal R demonstration: standard numeric types are floating approximations. No direct “rational type” in base R, though external packages exist:


``` r
library(data.table)
# We'll just store p, q pairs
rat <- function(p,q) p/q

rat(3,2)
```

```
## [1] 1.5
```

``` r
rat(22,7)  # approximate 22/7
```

```
## [1] 3.142857
```
