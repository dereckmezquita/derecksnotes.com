<a id="standard-deviation">Standard Deviation</a> - In **statistics**, the **standard deviation** (SD) is the square root of the [variance](#variance). It indicates how spread out the values in a [distribution](#distribution) are around the mean.

'57879'
\text{SD} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}.
'57879'

**Key points**:
- Low SD: data points are closer to the mean.
- High SD: data points are more spread out.

**R demonstration** (computing SD in base R):


``` r
library(data.table)
set.seed(123)
x_vals <- rnorm(30, mean=10, sd=2)
sd_val <- sd(x_vals)
sd_val
```
