<a id="dimension">Dimension</a> - **Dimension** generally refers to the number of coordinates needed to specify a point in a space:

- In **geometry**, 2D refers to a plane, 3D to space, etc.
- In **linear algebra**, dimension is the cardinality of a basis for a vector space.
- In **data science**, dimension often describes the number of features or columns in a dataset.

**Linear algebra perspective**:
If $V$ is a vector space over a field $\mathbb{F}$ and $\{\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n\}$ is a basis for $V$, then $\dim(V) = n$.

**R demonstration** (showing dimension of a data.table):


``` r
library(data.table)

dt_dim <- data.table(
  colA = rnorm(5),
  colB = rnorm(5),
  colC = rnorm(5)
)

# Number of rows
nrow(dt_dim)
```

```
## [1] 5
```

``` r
# Number of columns (dimension in the sense of data features)
ncol(dt_dim)
```

```
## [1] 3
```

We have a 5 × 3 data.table, so we can say it has 3 “features” or columns in that sense, but in linear algebra, dimension has a more formal meaning related to basis and span.
