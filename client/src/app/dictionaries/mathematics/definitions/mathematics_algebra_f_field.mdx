<a id="field">Field</a> - In **abstract algebra**, a **field** is a [ring](#ring) in which every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. The real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ and rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ are classic examples of fields.

**Key points**:
- Both addition and multiplication exist and distribute.
- Every nonzero element is invertible under multiplication.
- Foundation of much of modern mathematics (vector spaces, linear algebra).

No direct R demonstration typical.
