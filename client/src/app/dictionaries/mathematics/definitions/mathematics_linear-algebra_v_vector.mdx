<a id="vector">Vector</a> - In **linear algebra**, a **vector** is an element of a vector space. Commonly, in $\mathbb{R}^n$, a vector is an ordered list of real numbers, like:

$$
\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{pmatrix}.
$$

**Key points**:
- Vectors have [dimension](#dimension) $n$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
- Matrix operations can treat vectors as columns or rows.
- Magnitude (or [norm](#norm)) describes its length in Euclidean space.

**R demonstration** (simple vector in R):


``` r
library(data.table)

v <- c(1,2,3)
v_length <- sqrt(sum(v^2))
v
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3
```

``` r
v_length
```

```
## [1] 3.741657
```
