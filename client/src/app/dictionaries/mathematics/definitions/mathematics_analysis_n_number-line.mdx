<a id="number-line">Number Line</a> - The **number line** (real line) is a straight line on which every real number corresponds to a unique point. Basic structures like an [interval](#interval) are subsets of the number line:

- Negative numbers extend to the left, positive numbers to the right.
- Zero is typically placed at the origin.

No direct R demonstration is typical, but we can illustrate numeric representations:


``` r
library(data.table)

vals <- seq(-3, 3, by=1)
vals
```

```
## [1] -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3
```
