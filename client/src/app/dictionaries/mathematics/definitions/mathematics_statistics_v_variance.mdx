<a id="variance">Variance</a> - In **statistics**, **variance** measures how far a set of numbers (random variable outcomes) spreads out around its [mean](#mean). For a population with values $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ and mean $\mu$:

'58335'
\mathrm{Var}(X) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu)^2.
'58335'

For a sample-based estimate, the usual unbiased form has denominator $(n-1)$. The square root of variance is the [standard-deviation](#standard-deviation). Variance also helps describe a [distribution](#distribution)â€™s spread.

**R demonstration** (computing variance):


``` r
library(data.table)

set.seed(123)
vals <- rnorm(30, mean=5, sd=2)
pop_var   <- mean( (vals - mean(vals))^2 )   # population style
sample_var <- var(vals)  # sample style, uses denominator (n-1)
c(pop_var, sample_var)
```

```
