<a id="empty-set">∅ (Empty set)</a> - In **set theory**, the **empty set** ∅ is the unique set containing no elements. Symbolically:

'59270'
\varnothing = \{\},
'59270'

meaning it has cardinality 0. Any operation on ∅ typically yields minimal or neutral results. For instance, union with ∅ returns the other set unchanged.

**Key points**:
- ∅ is a subset of every [set](#set).
- It is distinct from \(\{\varnothing\}\), which is a set containing the empty set as an element.

No direct R demonstration needed, but we can show conceptually:


``` r
library(data.table)

empty_set <- vector(mode="list", length=0)  # a list with length 0
length(empty_set)
```

```
## [1] 0
```
