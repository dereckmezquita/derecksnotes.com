<a id="lhopitals-rule">L'Hôpital's Rule</a> - In **calculus**, **L'Hôpital's rule** is a result for evaluating certain indeterminate forms of [limit](#limit) expressions. If

$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}
$$

produces indeterminate forms like $0/0$ or $\infty/\infty$, then (under certain conditions involving differentiability and continuity):

$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)},
$$

provided the latter limit exists. It relies on the concept of the [derivative](#derivative).

**Simple R demonstration** (symbolic approach would be used in a CAS, but we can do numeric checks):


``` r
library(data.table)

f <- function(x) x^2 - 1
g <- function(x) x - 1

# Evaluate near x=1 to see 0/0
x_vals <- seq(0.9, 1.1, by=0.01)
dt_lhop <- data.table(
  x = x_vals,
  f_x = f(x_vals),
  g_x = g(x_vals),
  ratio = f(x_vals)/g(x_vals)
)
head(dt_lhop)
```

```
##        x     f_x   g_x ratio
##    <num>   <num> <num> <num>
## 1:  0.90 -0.1900 -0.10  1.90
## 2:  0.91 -0.1719 -0.09  1.91
## 3:  0.92 -0.1536 -0.08  1.92
## 4:  0.93 -0.1351 -0.07  1.93
## 5:  0.94 -0.1164 -0.06  1.94
## 6:  0.95 -0.0975 -0.05  1.95
```

We can see the ratio near x=1 is close to the ratio of derivatives at that point:
- f'(x) = 2x
- g'(x) = 1
So at x=1, ratio ~ 2(1)/1 = 2.
