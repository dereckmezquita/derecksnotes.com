<a id="partial-derivative-symbol">∂ (Partial derivative symbol)</a> - The **∂** symbol indicates a partial derivative, as in \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\). It generalises differentiation to functions of multiple variables (see [partial-derivative](#partial-derivative)).

**Key points**:
- ∂ is distinct from d in single-variable calculus.
- Common in PDEs (partial differential equations).

No direct R demonstration needed here, but partial derivatives can be approximated numerically.


``` r
library(data.table)

f_xy <- function(x,y) x^2 + 3*x*y
partial_x <- function(f, x, y, h=1e-6) (f(x+h,y)-f(x,y))/h
partial_x(f_xy, 2, 3)
```
