<a id="y-intercept">Y-intercept</a> - In **geometry**, the **y-intercept** of a curve is the point(s) where it crosses the [y-axis](#y-axis). Formally, points with x=0:

$$
\text{Find } y \text{ such that } f(0)=y.
$$

**Key points**:
- Solving for $f(0)$ often involves [polynomial](#polynomial) expressions or other functional forms.
- Graphically, y-intercepts appear where the plot crosses the vertical axis.

**R demonstration** (finding approximate y-intercept for a function):


``` r
library(data.table)

f <- function(x) x^2 - 4*x + 1
y_intercept <- f(0)
y_intercept
```

```
