<a id="t-statistic">T-Statistic</a> - In **statistics**, the **t-statistic** is used in a t-test to compare a sample [mean](#mean) to a hypothesised population mean (under the [null-hypothesis](#null-hypothesis)), typically when population [variance](#variance) is unknown. For sample size \(n\):

'57989'
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}},
'57989'

where \(\bar{x}\) is the sample mean, \(s\) is the sample standard deviation, and \(\mu_0\) is the hypothesised mean.

**R demonstration** (simple t-test):


``` r
library(data.table)

set.seed(123)
x_vals <- rnorm(20, mean=10, sd=2)
res_ttest <- t.test(x_vals, mu=9)
res_ttest
```

```
## 
## 	One Sample t-test
## 
## data:  x_vals
## t = 2.9501, df = 19, p-value = 0.008221
## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 9
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##   9.372805 11.193690
## sample estimates:
## mean of x 
##  10.28325
