<a id="combination">Combination</a> - In combinatorics, a **combination** is a way of selecting items from a collection, such that (unlike permutations) order does not matter.

- The number of ways to choose $k$ items from $n$ items is given by the binomial coefficient:
  54861
  \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.
  54861

**Key points**:
- $\binom{n}{k}$ is also read as “n choose k.”
- Combinations are used in probability, counting arguments, and binomial expansions.

**Example**:
- Choosing 3 team members from 10 candidates is $\binom{10}{3} = \frac{10!}{3!7!} = 120$.
