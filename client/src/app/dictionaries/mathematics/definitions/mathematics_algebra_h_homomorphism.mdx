<a id="homomorphism">Homomorphism</a> - In **algebra**, a **homomorphism** is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type. For instance, a **group** homomorphism between groups $G$ and $H$ is a function

55983
\phi: G \to H
55983

such that:

55983
\phi(a \cdot b) = \phi(a) \star \phi(b),
55983

where $\cdot$ is the operation in $G$ and $\star$ is the operation in $H$ (see [group](#group) for more on group operations).

This ensures that the algebraic structure (associativity, identity, inverses) is respected.

No direct R demonstration is typical for homomorphisms, but we can quickly illustrate a trivial map:


``` r
# As a simple example:
# A map from Z -> Z given by phi(x) = 2*x is a group homomorphism under addition.
phi <- function(x) 2*x

phi(3)  # 6
```

```
## [1] 6
```

``` r
# phi(a + b) = 2*(a + b) = 2a + 2b = phi(a) + phi(b)
```
