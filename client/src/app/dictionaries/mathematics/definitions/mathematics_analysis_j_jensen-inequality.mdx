<a id="jensen-inequality">Jensen's Inequality</a> - In **analysis**, **Jensenâ€™s inequality** states that for a convex function $\varphi$ and a random variable $X$,

56318
\varphi\bigl(E[X]\bigr) \le E\bigl[\varphi(X)\bigr].
56318

If $\varphi$ is concave, the inequality reverses. This has deep implications in [expectation](#expectation) and probability theory.

**R demonstration** (empirical illustration):


``` r
library(data.table)

set.seed(123)
X <- runif(1000, min=0, max=2)  # random draws in [0,2]

phi <- function(x) x^2  # a convex function

mean_X <- mean(X)
lhs <- phi(mean_X)
rhs <- mean(phi(X))

lhs
```

```
## [1] 0.9891408
```

``` r
rhs
```

```
## [1] 1.319398
```

``` r
# Typically: lhs <= rhs (Jensen's inequality for convex phi)
```
