<a id="summation">∑ (Summation)</a> - The **summation** symbol ∑ denotes adding a sequence of terms. For instance:

'59102'
\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k = a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n.
'59102'

**Key points**:
- See also [series](#series) for infinite sums.
- Sometimes called [sigma-notation](#sigma-notation).

**R demonstration** (summing up a vector):


``` r
library(data.table)

vals <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
sum_vals <- sum(vals)
sum_vals
```

```
## [1] 15
```
