<a id="weighted-average">Weighted Average</a> - A **weighted average** generalises the [mean](#mean) by assigning weights \(w_i\) to values \(x_i\). For a set of values \(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\) with weights \(w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n\):

$$
\bar{x}_w = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i }{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i }.
$$

If all weights \(w_i\) are equal, this reduces to the arithmetic mean (see [arithmetic](#arithmetic)).

**R demonstration**:


``` r
library(data.table)

vals <- c(3,5,10)
wts  <- c(1,2,5)  # weighting
weighted_mean <- sum(vals * wts)/sum(wts)
weighted_mean
```
