<a id="topological-space">Topological Space</a> - In **topology**, a **topological space** is a [set](#set) $X$ equipped with a collection of open sets that satisfy the axioms:
1. $\varnothing$ and $X$ are open.
2. Finite intersections of open sets are open.
3. Arbitrary unions of open sets are open.

**Key points**:
- Generalises notions of continuity, [boundary](#boundary), and “closeness” beyond Euclidean space.
- Foundation for manifold definitions, continuity arguments, convergence, etc.

No direct R demonstration (purely theoretical structure).
