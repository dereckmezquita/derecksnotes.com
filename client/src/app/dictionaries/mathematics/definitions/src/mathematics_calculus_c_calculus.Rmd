<a id="calculus">Calculus</a> - Calculus is the branch of mathematics that deals with continuous change. It is traditionally divided into two main parts:

- **Differential Calculus**: Concerned with rates of change and slopes of curves.
- **Integral Calculus**: Focuses on accumulation of quantities, areas under curves, etc.

**Core concepts**:
- **Limit**: 
  54861 
  \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L 
  54861
  if for all small enough ranges around $L$, the function $f(x)$ remains close to $L$.
- **Derivative**: 
  54861 
  f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h},
  54861
  which measures the instantaneous rate of change of $f$ at $x$.
- **Integral**:
  54861
  \int_a^b f(x)\,dx 
  54861
  represents the area under $f(x)$ from $x=a$ to $x=b$ (in one dimension).

Calculus is foundational in physics, engineering, economics, statistics, and many other fields.
