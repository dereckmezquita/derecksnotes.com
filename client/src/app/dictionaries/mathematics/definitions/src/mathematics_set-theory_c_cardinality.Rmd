<a id="cardinality">Cardinality</a> - In set theory, **cardinality** is a measure of the “number of elements” in a set. For finite sets, cardinality matches the usual concept of counting elements. For infinite sets, cardinalities compare the sizes of infinite sets via **bijections**.

**Examples**:
- The set $\{1, 2, 3\}$ has cardinality 3.
- The set of even integers has the same cardinality as the set of all integers ($\aleph_0$), since they can be put into a one-to-one correspondence.
- The real numbers have a strictly larger cardinality than the integers (uncountable infinity).

Cardinality helps classify and understand different types of infinities and is fundamental to understanding set-theoretic properties, such as countability vs. uncountability.
