<a id="bijection">Bijection</a> - A **bijection** (or **bijective function**) between two sets $A$ and $B$ is a one-to-one and onto mapping:

- **One-to-one (Injective)**: Different elements in $A$ map to different elements in $B$.
- **Onto (Surjective)**: Every element of $B$ is mapped from some element of $A$.

Formally, a function $f: A \to B$ is bijective if:
1. If $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$ then $a_1 = a_2$ (injectivity).
2. For every $b \in B$, there exists an $a \in A$ such that $f(a) = b$ (surjectivity).

**Examples**:
- $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) = x+1$, is bijective.
- Exponential $e^x$ from $\mathbb{R}\to (0,\infty)$ is bijective onto its image $(0, \infty)$.

Bijective functions are crucial in algebra, combinatorics, and many areas of mathematics because they establish a perfect “pairing” between sets, enabling one-to-one correspondences (e.g., counting arguments in combinatorics).
