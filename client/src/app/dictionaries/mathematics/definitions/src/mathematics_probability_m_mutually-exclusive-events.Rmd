<a id="mutually-exclusive-events">Mutually Exclusive Events</a> - In **probability**, two events $A$ and $B$ are **mutually exclusive** (or disjoint) if they cannot happen simultaneously:

56872
A \cap B = \varnothing.
56872

In other words, $P(A \cap B) = 0$. The [union](#union) of mutually exclusive events has a probability thatâ€™s just the sum of their individual probabilities:

56872
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B),
56872

since $A$ and $B$ never overlap.

**R demonstration**: no direct R function, but we can illustrate logic:

```{r}
# Suppose events are flipping a coin:
# A = heads, B = tails
# A and B are mutually exclusive.

# We can do a small simulation
set.seed(123)
flips <- sample(c("H","T"), size=100, replace=TRUE)
mean(flips == "H")  # approximate P(A)
mean(flips == "T")  # approximate P(B)
# Overlap: none, because a single flip can't be both H and T
```
