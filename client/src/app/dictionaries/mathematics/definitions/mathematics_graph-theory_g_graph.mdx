<a id="graph">Graph</a> - In **graph theory**, a **graph** is a set of vertices (nodes) connected by edges (links). Formally, a graph $G$ is a pair $(V, E)$ where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges (which are pairs of vertices).

**Types**:
- Simple vs. multigraph (multiple edges)
- Directed vs. undirected
- Weighted vs. unweighted

**Applications**:
- Social networks (people as nodes, relationships as edges)
- Transportation (cities as nodes, roads as edges)
- Computer science (data structures, BFS/DFS, shortest paths)

**R demonstration** (constructing a small graph with igraph):


``` r
library(igraph)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'igraph'
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
## 
##     decompose, spectrum
```

```
## The following object is masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     union
```

``` r
# Create an undirected graph with edges
g <- graph(edges=c("A","B", "B","C", "A","C", "C","D"), directed=FALSE)
```

```
## Warning: `graph()` was deprecated in igraph 2.1.0.
## â„¹ Please use `make_graph()` instead.
## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.
## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was generated.
```

``` r
plot(g, vertex.color="lightblue", vertex.size=30)
```
