<a id="infinity">∞ (Infinity)</a> - In **analysis**, **infinity** (∞) symbolises an unbounded value that grows beyond any finite number. It often appears in contexts of [limit](#limit) and the [extended-real-number-line](#extended-real-number-line).

**Key points**:
- Not a real number in standard arithmetic; it’s a conceptual extension.
- In set theory, there are different *sizes* (cardinalities) of infinity (ℵ₀, 2^ℵ₀, etc.).
- In calculus, writing \(x \to ∞\) indicates x grows without bound.

**R demonstration** (conceptual usage of Inf in R):


``` r
library(data.table)

val_inf <- Inf
val_inf
```

```
## [1] Inf
```

``` r
# Basic check
is.finite(val_inf)  # should be FALSE
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```
