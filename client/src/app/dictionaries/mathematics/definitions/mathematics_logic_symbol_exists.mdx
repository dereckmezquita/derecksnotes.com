<a id="exists">∃ (There exists)</a> - The **exists** symbol is used in **logic** to express the existence of at least one element satisfying a property. For example:

'59270'
\exists x \in A : P(x).
'59270'

means there is at least one x in A for which P(x) holds true.

**Key points**:
- Often used with [forall](#forall) statements to form more complex logical conditions.
- Symbolically pairs with optional uniqueness, e.g. “there exists exactly one.”

No direct R demonstration; it’s a logical concept.  

``` r
cat("∃ is used in statements like 'There exists x in A such that...'")
```

```
## ∃ is used in statements like 'There exists x in A such that...'
```
