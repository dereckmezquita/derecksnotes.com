<a id="surjection">Surjection</a> - In **functions** (set theory), a **surjection** (or onto function) is a function $f: A \to B$ such that every element in $B$ has at least one preimage in $A$. Formally:

'59475'
\forall b \in B, \exists a \in A : f(a) = b.
'59475'

**Key points**:
- Every element of $B$ is “hit” by the function.
- Contrasts with [injection](#injection) (one-to-one). If a function is both surjective and injective, it’s a [bijection](#bijection).

**R demonstration** (not typical, but we can illustrate a partial concept with sets):


``` r
library(data.table)

A <- 1:5
B <- letters[1:5]

# We'll define f: A->B, f(n) = the nth letter
f_surjective <- function(n) letters[n]

dt_map <- data.table(a = A, f_of_a = sapply(A, f_surjective))
dt_map
```

```
##        a f_of_a
##    <int> <char>
## 1:     1      a
## 2:     2      b
## 3:     3      c
## 4:     4      d
## 5:     5      e
```

``` r
# This is surjective over B=letters[1:5], as all letters a through e appear.
```
