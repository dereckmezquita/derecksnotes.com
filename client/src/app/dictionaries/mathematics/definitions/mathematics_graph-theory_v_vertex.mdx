<a id="vertex">Vertex</a> - In **graph theory**, a **vertex** (also called a node) is a fundamental unit of a [graph](#graph). A graph $G=(V,E)$ consists of a set of vertices $V$ and edges $E$ between them.

**Key points**:
- The number of vertices is often denoted $|V|$.
- Adjacency lists or matrices represent connections among vertices.

**R demonstration** (simple use of `igraph` with vertices):


``` r
library(igraph)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'igraph'
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
## 
##     decompose, spectrum
```

```
## The following object is masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     union
```

``` r
g <- graph(edges=c("A","B","B","C","C","D"), directed=FALSE)
```

```
## Warning: `graph()` was deprecated in igraph 2.1.0.

```

``` r
V(g)  # show vertices
```

```
## + 4/4 vertices, named, from 92e395a:
## [1] A B C D
```

``` r
plot(g, vertex.color="lightgreen", vertex.size=30, edge.arrow.size=0.5)
```
