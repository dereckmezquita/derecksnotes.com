<a id="set">Set</a> - In **mathematics**, a **set** is a well-defined collection of distinct objects. Notation often uses curly braces: $\{a, b, c\}$. Operations like [intersection](#intersection), [union](#union), and subset relationships form the basis of **set theory**.

**Key points**:
- No repeated elements: sets ignore duplicates.
- Can contain any type of object, even other sets.

**R demonstration**:


``` r
library(data.table)

A <- c(1,2,3)
B <- c(3,4,5)
intersect(A,B)
```

```
## [1] 3
```

``` r
union(A,B)
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5
```
