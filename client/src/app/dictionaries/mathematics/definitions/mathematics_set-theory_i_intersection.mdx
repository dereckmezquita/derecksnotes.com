<a id="intersection">Intersection</a> - In **set theory**, the **intersection** of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of elements that belong to both $A$ and $B$. Symbolically:

$$
A \cap B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \}.
$$

- Compare this with the [union](#union) $A \cup B$, which combines all elements in either $A$ or $B$.
- The empty set $\varnothing$ results if $A$ and $B$ share no elements.

No special R demonstration is typically needed, but we can illustrate a basic example using sets as vectors:


``` r
A <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
B <- c(3, 4, 5, 6)

intersect(A, B)  # yields 3,4
```

```
## [1] 3 4
```
