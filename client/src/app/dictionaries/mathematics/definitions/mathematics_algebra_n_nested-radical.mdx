<a id="nested-radical">Nested Radical</a> - A **nested radical** is an expression containing radicals (square roots, etc.) inside other radicals, for example:

'56956'
\sqrt{a + \sqrt{b + \sqrt{c + \dots}}}
'56956'

Such expressions sometimes simplify to closed-forms. A famous example is:

'56956'
\sqrt{1 + 2\sqrt{1 + 3\sqrt{1 + 4\sqrt{1+ \dots}}}}
'56956'

Though symbolic manipulation is more typical than numeric for these. Minimal R demonstration here:


``` r
# We could approximate a short nested radical numerically:
nested_radical_approx <- function(n) {
  # approximate: sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(1+...  up to n steps
  # This is more a demonstration than a standard function
  val <- 0
  for(k in seq(n, 2, by=-1)) {
    val <- sqrt(1 + k*val)
  }
  sqrt(1 + 2*val) # final
}

nested_radical_approx(5)
```

```
