<a id="wavelet">Wavelet</a> - In **analysis** and signal processing, a **wavelet** is a function used to decompose and analyse signals at multiple scales. Unlike the [fourier-transform](#fourier-transform) which uses infinite sine and cosine waves, wavelets are localised in both time (space) and frequency.

**Key points**:
- Wavelets are useful for time-frequency or space-scale analysis.
- Common families: Haar, Daubechies, Morlet, etc.

**R demonstration** (no base function for wavelets, but let's show a conceptual signal transform snippet):


``` r
# This is conceptual, as wavelet packages (e.g. 'wavelets') would be used.
# We'll do a simple mock demonstration of a signal decomposition approach.

library(data.table)
set.seed(123)
signal <- c(rep(0,50), rnorm(50), rep(0,50))

# Suppose we apply a placeholder "wavelet transform"
# (here, just a naive split for illustration)
signal_low  <- filter(signal, rep(1/2,2), sides=2)  # naive "approx" 
signal_high <- signal - signal_low                  # naive "detail"

dt_wav <- data.table(
  idx = seq_along(signal),
  signal = signal,
  approx = signal_low,
  detail = signal_high
)
head(dt_wav, 10)
```

```
##       idx signal approx detail
##     <int>  <num>   <ts>   <ts>
##  1:     1      0      0      0
##  2:     2      0      0      0
##  3:     3      0      0      0
##  4:     4      0      0      0
##  5:     5      0      0      0
##  6:     6      0      0      0
##  7:     7      0      0      0
##  8:     8      0      0      0
##  9:     9      0      0      0
## 10:    10      0      0      0
```
