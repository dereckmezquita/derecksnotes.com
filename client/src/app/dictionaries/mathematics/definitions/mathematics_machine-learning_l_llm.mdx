<a id="llm">LLM (Large Language Model)</a> - A **large language model** is typically a **Transformer**-based or similarly advanced architecture with billions (or more) of parameters, trained on massive text corpora to generate coherent text or perform NLP tasks.

**Key points**:
- Uses self-attention to handle long contexts.
- Learns complex linguistic structures, can generate next tokens based on context.

**Mathematical gist**:
At each token step, an LLM computes a probability distribution over the vocabulary:
$$
p(x_{t+1}\mid x_{1:\dots:t}) = \mathrm{softmax}(h_t W_{\text{vocab}}),
$$
where $h_t$ is the hidden representation after attention layers.

**R demonstration** (We can show a mini example of text generation with `keras`, but typically giant LLM training isn't feasible in R. We'll do conceptual snippet):


``` r
# Conceptual only:
library(data.table)
cat("Training an LLM is typically done in Python with large GPU clusters.\nWe'll do a small toy example with a simple RNN or minimal next-token model.")
```

```
