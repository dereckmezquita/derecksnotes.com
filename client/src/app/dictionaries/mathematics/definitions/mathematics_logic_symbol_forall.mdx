<a id="forall">∀ (For all)</a> - The **forall** symbol is used in **logic** and set theory to denote “for all elements” in a [set](#set). For example:

'59270'
\forall x \in A, \quad P(x).
'59270'

This states that for every element x of set A, the proposition P(x) holds.

**Key points**:
- Central in **universal-quantification** statements.
- Often combined with \(\exists\) (there exists) to form more complex logical formulas.

No special R demonstration needed; it’s a logical/quantifier concept.  

``` r
cat("∀ is used purely in logical statements: 'For all x in A...'")
```

```
## ∀ is used purely in logical statements: 'For all x in A...'
```
