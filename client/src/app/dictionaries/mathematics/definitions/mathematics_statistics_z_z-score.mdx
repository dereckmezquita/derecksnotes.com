<a id="z-score">Z-score</a> - In **statistics**, a **z-score** (or standard score) is the number of [standard-deviation](#standard-deviation)s by which the value of an observation differs from the [mean](#mean). For an observation $x$ in a sample:

$$
z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{s},
$$

where \(\bar{x}\) is the sample mean and \(s\) is the sample SD (see [variance](#variance) / SD). In a normal [distribution](#distribution), z-scores help locate observations relative to the population mean.

**R demonstration**:


``` r
library(data.table)

set.seed(123)
vals <- rnorm(10, mean=10, sd=2)
z_scores <- (vals - mean(vals)) / sd(vals)
z_scores
```
