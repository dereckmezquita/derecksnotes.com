<a id="partial-derivative">Partial Derivative</a> - In **multivariable calculus**, a **partial derivative** of a function
'57323'
f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)
'57323'
with respect to $x_k$ is the derivative treating $x_k$ as the only variable, holding others constant:

'57323'
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_k}(x_1,\dots,x_n) = 
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(\dots, x_k + h, \dots) - f(\dots, x_k, \dots)}{h}.
'57323'

**Key points**:
- Used in computing the [gradient](#gradient).
- The concept generalises [derivative](#derivative) to higher dimensions.

**R demonstration** (numerical approximation for $f(x,y)= x^2 + 2xy$ wrt $x$):


``` r
library(data.table)

f_xy <- function(x,y) x^2 + 2*x*y

partial_x <- function(f, x, y, h=1e-6) {
  (f(x+h, y) - f(x, y)) / h
}

val <- partial_x(f_xy, 2, 3)
val
```

```
## [1] 10
```

``` r
# Compare to analytic partial derivative wrt x: 2x + 2y. 
# At (2,3) => 2*2 + 2*3=4+6=10
```
