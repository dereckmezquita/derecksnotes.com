<a id="implies">⇒ (Implies)</a> - In **logic**, **⇒** is used to denote implication. “A ⇒ B” means if A holds (is true), then B must also be true. In formal terms:

'59270'
A \implies B \quad\equiv\quad \neg A \lor B.
'59270'

**Key points**:
- Logic statements often chain multiple implications.
- Pairs with equivalences, [forall](#forall), [exists](#exists), etc.

No direct R demonstration, as it’s a symbolic part of logic:


``` r
cat("A => B is read as 'A implies B'. If A is true, B must be true.")
```

```
## A => B is read as 'A implies B'. If A is true, B must be true.
```
