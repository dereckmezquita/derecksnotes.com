<a id="permutation">Permutation</a> - In **combinatorics**, a **permutation** is an arrangement of all or part of a set of objects in a specific order. For $n$ distinct elements, the number of ways to arrange all of them is $n!$. When selecting $k$ from $n$ in an ordered manner:

$$
P(n, k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.
$$

Compare with a [combination](#combination), where order does not matter.

**R demonstration** (simple function for permutation count):


``` r
library(data.table)

perm_func <- function(n,k) factorial(n)/factorial(n-k)

perm_5_3 <- perm_func(5,3)
perm_5_3
```

```
## [1] 60
```

``` r
# which is 5!/2! = 60
```
