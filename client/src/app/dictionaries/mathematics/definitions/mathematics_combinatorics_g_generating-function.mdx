<a id="generating-function">Generating Function</a> - A **generating function** is a formal power series whose coefficients encode information about a sequence $(a_n)$. For instance:

55763
G(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n.
55763

**Key points**:
- Used extensively in combinatorics to derive closed forms or recurrences.
- Different types (ordinary, exponential) depending on the combinatorial interpretation.

**Example**: The ordinary generating function for the sequence $\{1,1,1,\dots\}$ is

55763
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n = \frac{1}{1-x}, \quad |x|<1.
55763

No direct data.table example is typical here, but generating functions are used in discrete math. One might do symbolic manipulations with external packages. We can, however, illustrate partial sums numerically:


``` r
library(data.table)

x_val <- 0.2
num_terms <- 10

dt_genfun <- data.table(
  n = 0:(num_terms-1)
)

dt_genfun[, term := x_val^n]
partial_sum <- dt_genfun[, sum(term)]
partial_sum
```

```
## [1] 1.25
```

``` r
# Compare to closed-form 1/(1 - x_val)
closed_form <- 1 / (1 - x_val)
closed_form
```

```
## [1] 1.25
```
