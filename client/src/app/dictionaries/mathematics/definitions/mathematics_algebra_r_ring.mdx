<a id="ring">Ring</a> - In **abstract algebra**, a **ring** is a set equipped with two binary operations (usually called addition and multiplication), satisfying:

1. (R, +) is an abelian [group](#group).
2. Multiplication is associative.
3. Distributive laws link the two operations:  
   $ a \times (b + c) = a\times b + a\times c$ and $(b + c)\times a = b\times a + c\times a$.

**Key points**:
- Rings may or may not have a multiplicative identity (1). If present, we say it’s a “ring with unity.”
- A [field](#field) is a ring where every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.

No direct R demonstration typical for ring structure, but we can mention integer arithmetic as a ring:


``` r
cat("Integers under + and * form a classic ring.")
```

```
## Integers under + and * form a classic ring.
```
