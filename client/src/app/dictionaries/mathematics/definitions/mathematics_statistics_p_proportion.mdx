<a id="proportion">Proportion</a> - In **statistics**, a **proportion** represents a fraction of the whole—essentially, how many observations fall into a particular category, divided by the total.  

'57323'
\text{proportion} = \frac{\text{count of interest}}{\text{total count}}.
'57323'

**Key points**:
- Used in categorical data analysis.
- Confidence intervals for a proportion use techniques like the Wald method, Wilson method, etc.

**R demonstration** (simple proportion of “heads” in coin flips):


``` r
library(data.table)

set.seed(123)
flips <- sample(c("H","T"), 50, replace=TRUE)
prop_heads <- mean(flips=="H")
prop_heads
```

```
## [1] 0.6
```
