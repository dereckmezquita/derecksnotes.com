<a id="young-tableau">Young Tableau</a> - In **combinatorics** and representation theory, a **Young tableau** is a grid diagram (partition shape) where cells are filled with numbers (or symbols) that obey certain row/column ordering. A **standard Young tableau** uses distinct numbers \(1,2,...,n\) that strictly increase left-to-right in rows and top-to-bottom in columns.

**Key points**:
- Related to [partition](#partition) of integers (diagrams shaped by partition lengths).
- Vital in symmetric function theory and representation theory of symmetric groups.

**R demonstration** (no base R function for Young tableaux, but we can show a small layout):


``` r
library(data.table)

# We'll just define a small 'shape' as row lengths, e.g. partition (3,2)
# Then store a possible filling as a standard Young tableau

young_shape <- list(c(1,2,3), c(4,5))  # conceptual: row1=(1,2,3), row2=(4,5)
young_shape
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 1 2 3
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 4 5
```
