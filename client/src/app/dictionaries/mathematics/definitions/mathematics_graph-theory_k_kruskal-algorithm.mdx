<a id="kruskal-algorithm">Kruskal's Algorithm</a> - In **graph theory**, **Kruskal's algorithm** finds a minimum spanning tree (MST) of a weighted [graph](#graph) by:

1. Sorting edges in order of increasing weight.
2. Adding edges one by one to the MST, provided they do not form a cycle.
3. Repeating until all vertices are connected or edges are exhausted.

This greedy approach ensures an MST if the graph is connected. 

**R demonstration** (a small example with igraph):


``` r
library(igraph)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'igraph'
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
## 
##     decompose, spectrum
```

```
## The following object is masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     union
```

``` r
# Create a weighted graph
g <- graph(edges=c("A","B","B","C","A","C","C","D","B","D"),
           directed=FALSE)
```

```

```

``` r
E(g)$weight <- c(2, 4, 5, 1, 3)  # just some weights

# Use built-in MST function that uses Kruskal internally
mst_g <- mst(g)
mst_g
```

```
## IGRAPH d1aa2b3 UNW- 4 3 -- 
## + attr: name (v/c), weight (e/n)
## + edges from d1aa2b3 (vertex names):
## [1] A--B C--D B--D
```

``` r
# Let's plot
plot(mst_g, vertex.color="lightblue", vertex.size=30,
     edge.label=E(mst_g)$weight)
```
