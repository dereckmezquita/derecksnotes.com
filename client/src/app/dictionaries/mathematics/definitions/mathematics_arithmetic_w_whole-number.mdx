<a id="whole-number">Whole Number</a> - A **whole number** typically refers to the non-negative integers:

'58445'
\{0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}.
'58445'

Depending on convention, “whole numbers” may or may not include zero. They are part of [arithmetic](#arithmetic) operations on integers (add, subtract, multiply, etc.).

**Key Points**:
- Whole numbers are closed under addition and multiplication.
- Subtraction can lead outside the set if the result is negative (unless zero is included, etc.).

No direct R demonstration needed, but we can illustrate basic set membership:


``` r
whole_nums <- 0:10
whole_nums
```

```
##  [1]  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```
