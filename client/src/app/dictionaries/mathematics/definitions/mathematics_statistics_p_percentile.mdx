<a id="percentile">Percentile</a> - In **statistics**, a **percentile** is a measure used to indicate the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations falls. For example, the 50th percentile is the [median](#median). 

**Key points**:
- Commonly used in test scores, growth charts, and any context where relative standing is measured.
- The [distribution](#distribution) of data helps interpret percentile rank.

**R demonstration** (finding percentiles via `quantile`):


``` r
library(data.table)

set.seed(123)
dt_p <- data.table(vals = rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=1))
quantile(dt_p$vals, probs=c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
```

```
##         25%         50%         75% 
## -0.49385424  0.06175631  0.69181917
```
