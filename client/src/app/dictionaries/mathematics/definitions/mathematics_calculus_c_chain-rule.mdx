<a id="chain-rule">Chain Rule</a> - In differential calculus, the **chain rule** provides a way to compute the derivative of a composite function. If $f$ and $g$ are differentiable, and $h(x) = f(g(x))$, then:

$$
h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x).
$$

**Key points**:
- It generalises the idea that the rate of change of a composition depends on the rate of change of the outer function evaluated at the inner function, multiplied by the rate of change of the inner function itself.
- It appears frequently in problems involving functions of functions, e.g. if $f(u)$ and $u(x)$.

**Example**:
- If $y = (x^2 + 1)^5$, then letting $u = x^2 + 1$, we have $y = u^5$.
  - $\frac{dy}{du} = 5u^4$
  - $\frac{du}{dx} = 2x$
  - Thus, $\frac{dy}{dx} = 5u^4 \cdot 2x = 10x(x^2 + 1)^4$.
