<a id="sample">Sample</a> - In **statistics**, a **sample** is a subset taken from a larger population, used to infer characteristics (such as a [distribution](#distribution)) of that population. Random sampling is crucial to reduce bias.

**Key points**:
- **Sample size** is the number of observations in the subset.
- Methods of sampling include simple random sampling, stratified sampling, etc.

**R demonstration** (random sample from a vector):


``` r
library(data.table)

vals <- 1:100
set.seed(123)
sample_vals <- sample(vals, 10)
sample_vals
```

```
##  [1] 31 79 51 14 67 42 50 43 97 25
```
