<a id="basis">Basis</a> - In linear algebra, a **basis** of a vector space $V$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$ is a set of vectors that:

1. **Span** $V$: Every vector in $V$ can be written as a linear combination of those basis vectors.
2. Are **linearly independent**: No vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others.

If $\mathcal{B} = \{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n\}\$ is a basis for $V$, then any $\mathbf{x} \in V$ can be uniquely expressed as:

54708
\mathbf{x} = c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + c_n \mathbf{v}_n,
54708

where $c_i \in \mathbb{F}$.

**Examples**:
- The set \(\{(1,0), (0,1)\}\) is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^2$.
- The set of monomials \(\{1, x, x^2, \dots, x^n\}\) forms a basis for the space of polynomials of degree $\le n$.

Finding a basis is central to problems in linear algebra such as simplifying linear transformations, solving systems of equations, and diagonalising matrices.
