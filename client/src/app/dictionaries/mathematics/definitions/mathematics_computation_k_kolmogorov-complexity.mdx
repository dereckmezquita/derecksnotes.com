<a id="kolmogorov-complexity">Kolmogorov Complexity</a> - In **algorithmic information theory**, **Kolmogorov complexity** of a string is the length of the shortest description (program) that can produce that string on a universal computer (like a universal Turing machine). 

**Key Points**:
- Measures the “information content” of a string.
- Uncomputable in the general case (no algorithm can compute the exact Kolmogorov complexity for every string).
- Often used to reason about randomness and compressibility.

No direct R demonstration is typical, as computing or estimating Kolmogorov complexity is a deep problem, but we can reason about approximate compression lengths with standard compressors.
