<a id="zero">Zero</a> - In **arithmetic**, **zero** (0) is the additive identity. Adding zero to a number leaves it unchanged:

$$
x + 0 = x.
$$

**Key points**:
- It belongs to the [whole-number](#whole-number) system (and integers).
- [Arithmetic](#arithmetic) with zero is straightforward: multiplication by 0 yields 0.
- In linear algebra, the [identity-matrix](#identity-matrix) uses 1 on diagonals but 0 off-diagonal.

Minimal R demonstration:


``` r
library(data.table)

x <- 5
x_plus_zero <- x + 0
x_plus_zero
```

```
## [1] 5
```
