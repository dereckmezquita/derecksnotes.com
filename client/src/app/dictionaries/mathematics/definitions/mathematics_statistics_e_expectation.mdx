<a id="expectation">Expectation</a> - In probability theory, the **expectation** (or expected value) of a random variable $X$ represents the long-run average outcome of $X$ after many repetitions of an experiment.

For a discrete random variable:

$$
E[X] = \sum_{x} x\, p(x).
$$

For a continuous random variable:

$$
E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x\, f_X(x) \, dx,
$$

where $f_X(x)$ is the probability density function.

**R demonstration** (empirical estimation of expectation):


``` r
library(data.table)

set.seed(123)
# Suppose X ~ Uniform(0, 10)
X_samples <- runif(10000, min=0, max=10)

dtX <- data.table(X = X_samples)

# Empirical mean
emp_mean <- mean(dtX$X)

# Theoretical expectation for Uniform(0, 10) is 5
theoretical <- 5

emp_mean
```
