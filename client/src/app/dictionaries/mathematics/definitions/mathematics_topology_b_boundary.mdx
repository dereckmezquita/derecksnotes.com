<a id="boundary">Boundary</a> - In topology (or geometric contexts), the **boundary** of a set $S$ in a topological space $X$ is the set of points $x \in X$ where every open neighbourhood of $x$ intersects both $S$ and its complement.

Formally, the boundary of $S$, denoted $\partial S$, is:

$$
\partial S = \overline{S} \cap \overline{X \setminus S},
$$

where $\overline{A}$ denotes the closure of a set $A$. Intuitively, these are “edge” points that can’t be classified as entirely inside or outside $S$ without ambiguity.

**Examples**:
- In $\mathbb{R}$ (with usual topology), the boundary of an interval $[a, b]$ is the set $\{a, b\}$.
- In $\mathbb{R}^2$, the boundary of a disk of radius $r$ is the circle of radius $r$.

Boundaries are key in analysis (defining open/closed sets) and in geometry (curves, surfaces).
