<a id="harmonic-mean">Harmonic Mean</a> - The **harmonic mean** of a set of positive numbers 
$x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ is defined by:

55983
\text{HM} = \frac{n}{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{x_i}}.
55983

- This measure is particularly useful when averaging rates or ratios.
- Compare with the [arithmetic](#arithmetic) mean (the usual average), and other means (geometric, quadratic, etc.).

**R demonstration** (computing harmonic mean):


``` r
library(data.table)

harmonic_mean <- function(x) {
  n <- length(x)
  n / sum(1/x)
}

dt_hm <- data.table(values = c(2, 3, 6, 6, 12))
my_hm <- harmonic_mean(dt_hm$values)
my_hm
```

```
