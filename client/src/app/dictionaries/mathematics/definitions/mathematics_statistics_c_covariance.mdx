<a id="covariance">Covariance</a> - In statistics and probability theory, **covariance** measures the joint variability of two random variables $X$ and $Y$:

$$
\mathrm{Cov}(X, Y) = E\bigl[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])\bigr].
$$

**Key observations**:
- If $X$ and $Y$ tend to increase together, covariance is positive.
- If one tends to increase when the other decreases, covariance is negative.
- A covariance of zero does not necessarily imply independence (unless under specific conditions, like normality).

**Example in R**:

``` r
set.seed(123)
X <- rnorm(10, mean=5, sd=2)
Y <- rnorm(10, mean=7, sd=3)
cov(X, Y)
```

```

Covariance forms the basis of **correlation** (a normalised version of covariance) and is central in statistics (e.g., linear regression, portfolio variance in finance).
