<a id="derivative">Derivative</a> - In calculus, the **derivative** of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x = a$ measures the rate at which $f$ changes with respect to $x$.

Formally, the derivative $f'(a)$ is defined by:

55354
f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}.
55354

**Key points**:
- Geometric interpretation: The slope of the tangent line to $y = f(x)$ at $x = a$.
- Practical interpretation: Instantaneous rate of change (e.g. velocity from position).

**Simple R demonstration** (numerical approximation):


``` r
# We'll approximate the derivative of f(x) = x^2 at x=2 using a small h
f <- function(x) x^2

numeric_derivative <- function(f, a, h = 1e-5) {
  (f(a + h) - f(a)) / h
}

approx_deriv_2 <- numeric_derivative(f, 2)
actual_deriv_2 <- 2 * 2  # derivative of x^2 is 2x, so at x=2 it's 4

approx_deriv_2
```

```
## [1] 4.00001
```

``` r
actual_deriv_2
```

```
## [1] 4
```

We see that $f'(2) = 4$ exactly, while our numeric approximation should be close to 4 for a suitably small $h$.
