<a id="real-number">Real Number</a> - A **real number** is a value on the continuous [number-line](#number-line), including both rational and irrational numbers. The set of real numbers is typically denoted \(\mathbb{R}\). Intervals (see [interval](#interval)) are subsets of real numbers.

**Key points**:
- Complete ordered field: every Cauchy sequence converges in \(\mathbb{R}\).
- Used in nearly all continuous mathematics contexts (calculus, analysis, measurement).

No special R demonstration: standard R numeric types approximate real numbers (double precision floats).
