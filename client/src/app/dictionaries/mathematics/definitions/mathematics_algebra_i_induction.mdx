<a id="induction">Induction</a> - **Mathematical induction** is a proof technique used to show that a statement holds for all natural numbers. It involves two steps:

1. **Base Case**: Prove the statement for the first natural number (often $n=1$).
2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some $n=k$, and then prove it holds for $n=k+1$.

This relies on the well-ordering principle of the natural numbers.

Consider a simple example with [arithmetic](#arithmetic) progressions:
- We may prove $1 + 2 + \dots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ by induction.

No complicated R demonstration is typical here, but we can at least verify sums for a few values:


``` r
library(data.table)

n_vals <- 1:10
dt_ind <- data.table(
  n     = n_vals,
  sum_n = sapply(n_vals, function(k) sum(1:k)),
  formula = n_vals*(n_vals+1)/2
)

dt_ind
```

```
##         n sum_n formula
##     <int> <int>   <num>
##  1:     1     1       1
##  2:     2     3       3
##  3:     3     6       6
##  4:     4    10      10
##  5:     5    15      15
##  6:     6    21      21
##  7:     7    28      28
##  8:     8    36      36
##  9:     9    45      45
## 10:    10    55      55
```
