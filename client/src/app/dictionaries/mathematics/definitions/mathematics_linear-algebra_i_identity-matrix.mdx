<a id="identity-matrix">Identity Matrix</a> - In linear algebra, the **identity matrix** $I_n$ is an $n \times n$ square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere:

$$
I_n = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & 1
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

**Key points**:
- $I_n$ serves as the multiplicative identity for matrices: $I_n A = A I_n = A$.
- Its [determinant](#determinant) is 1 for all $n$.
- Invertible matrices always have an identity matrix (the “unit” of their multiplicative structure).

**R demonstration** (creating identity matrices):


``` r
library(data.table)

I2 <- diag(2)
I3 <- diag(3)

I2
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1    0
## [2,]    0    1
```

``` r
I3
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    0    0
## [2,]    0    1    0
## [3,]    0    0    1
```
