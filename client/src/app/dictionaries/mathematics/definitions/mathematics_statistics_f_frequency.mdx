<a id="frequency">Frequency</a> - **Frequency** in mathematics and statistics can refer to:

1. **Statistical frequency**: How often a value appears in a dataset.
2. **Periodic phenomenon**: The number of cycles per unit time (e.g., in sine waves, signals).

**Statistical frequency**:
- Relative frequency = count of event / total observations.
- Frequency table is a basic summary in data analysis.

**Periodic frequency** (in signals):
- If $f(t) = \sin(2\pi \, \nu \, t)$, then $\nu$ is the frequency in cycles per unit time.

**R demonstration** (calculating frequencies in a categorical dataset):


``` r
library(data.table)

# Suppose a small categorical variable
dt_freq <- data.table(
  category = c("A", "B", "A", "C", "B", "A", "B", "B", "C")
)

# Frequency count
freq_table <- dt_freq[, .N, by=category]
setnames(freq_table, "N", "count")

freq_table[, rel_freq := count / sum(count)]
freq_table
```

```
##    category count  rel_freq
##      <char> <int>     <num>
## 1:        A     3 0.3333333
## 2:        B     4 0.4444444
## 3:        C     2 0.2222222
```
