<a id="zeckendorf-representation">Zeckendorf Representation</a> - In **number theory**, **Zeckendorfâ€™s theorem** states every positive integer can be uniquely written as a sum of nonconsecutive Fibonacci numbers. This sum is called the **Zeckendorf representation**. For example, 17 = 13 + 3 + 1 uses Fibonacci numbers (1,2,3,5,8,13, ...).

**Key points**:
- No two consecutive Fibonacci numbers are used in the representation.
- The representation is unique for each positive integer.

**R demonstration** (a naive function to find Zeckendorf representation):


``` r
library(data.table)

zeckendorf <- function(n) {
  # build fibonacci up to n
  fib <- c(1,2)
  while(tail(fib,1) < n) {
    fib <- c(fib, fib[length(fib)] + fib[length(fib)-1])
  }
  representation <- c()
  remaining <- n
  for (f in rev(fib)) {
    if (f <= remaining) {
      representation <- c(representation, f)
      remaining <- remaining - f
    }
  }
  representation
}

zeckendorf(17)  # expect 13,3,1
```

```
## [1] 13  3  1
```
