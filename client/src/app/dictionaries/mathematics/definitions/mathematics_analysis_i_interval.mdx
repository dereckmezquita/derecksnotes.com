<a id="interval">Interval</a> - In **analysis**, an **interval** is a connected subset of the [real-number-line](#real-number-line). Common types of intervals include:

- **Open interval**: $(a,b) = \{ x : a < x < b \}$
- **Closed interval**: $[a,b] = \{ x : a \le x \le b \}$
- **Half-open / half-closed**: $(a,b] = \{ x : a < x \le b \}$, etc.

Intervals are the building blocks of basic topology on the real line and are central in defining integrals, continuity, and other concepts of real analysis.


``` r
# Minimal R demonstration: we can define intervals simply with numeric vectors
my_interval <- 0:5  # representing discrete steps from 0 to 5
my_interval
```
