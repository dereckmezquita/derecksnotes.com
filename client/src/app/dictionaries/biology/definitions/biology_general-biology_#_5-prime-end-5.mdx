<a id="5_prime_end_5">5 Prime End (5')</a> - The 5' or 5 prime end of a [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) or [RNA](#rna) molecule is the end that holds the terminal phosphate (\-PO4). This allows for the formation of the [phosphodiester bond](#phosphodiesterBond) between two [nucleotides](#nucleotide). The other end of a nucleic strand is the [3' or 3 prime end ](#3_prime_end_3), which has the hydroxyl group (\-OH). For an illustration see the figure for [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid).
