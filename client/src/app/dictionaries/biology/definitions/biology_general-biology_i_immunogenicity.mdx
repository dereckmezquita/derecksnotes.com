<a id="immunogenicity">Immunogenicity</a> - Is the potential of a substance to induce an immune response. This depends on various factors:
- The species and state of the animal - its genome, immunological past, and physiological state.
- The degree of structural similarity of the [antigen](#antigen) to the [molecules](#molecule) of the target animal.
- The dose of the injected [antigen](#antigen).
- The physical and chemical characteristics of the [antigen](#antigen):  
   - Its size it must contain at least two [epitopes](#epitope_antigenic_determinant) in order to be fixed by an [antibody](#antibody).  
   - Its form if it is a particle or not.  
   - Its rigidity in order to be [complementary](#complementary) to other [paratopes](#paratope_antigen_binding_site).
