<a id="michaelis_menten_kinetics">Michaelis-Menten Kinetics</a> - A chemical kinetic scheme for describing the rate of an [enzyme](#enzyme)-[catalysed](#catalysation) processes. It relates the rate of reaction rate V at which the product \[P\] is formed, to the depletion of the substrate \[S\] from which it is produced. These are linked by Km the Michaelis constant, which corresponds to the substrate \[S\] concentration at which the speed v is half the vmax.

There are a few terms to take into consideration before attacking the formula#miRna: vmax is the maximal speed at which the reaction will take place, (vmax/2) is half maximal speed, which brings us to km or the substrate concentration at which the rate of reaction will half speed.

$$
    \nu = \frac{d[P]}{dt} = \frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m + [S]}
$$

km can be isolated in the following way:

$$
    km = \frac{V_{max}[S] - \nu[S]}{\nu}
$$

Its simplest formulation considers three processes:

1. The binding of substrate to enzyme
2. The unbinding of the substrate-enzyme complex
3. The conversion of the enzyme-substrate complex to the product and the enzyme

Using [mass-action kinetics](#mass_action_kinetics) and the assumption that [enzyme](#enzyme) [concentrations](#concentration) are much smaller than substrate [concentrations](#concentration), we get an equation for the rate of product (P) production (initial velocity); where Vmax is the maximal velocity (saturating substrate conditions) and Km is the Michaelis constant (the substrate [concentration](#concentration) at half-maximal velocity). More complex [Michaelis-Menten](#michaelis_menten_kinetics) formulations must be used if the release of the product from the enzyme-product complex is slow, ordered-binding is required, or [inhibitors](#inhibitor) are present.
