<a id="terminator">Terminator</a> - The process of termination is the stopping of [transcription](#transcription). This occurs due to particular sequences, terminator sequences, within the [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid). Some terminators cause termination by causing the [RNA](#rna) to fold into structures that cause the [RNA](#rna_polymerase_rna_p) to release it. Others recruit [proteins](#protein) which pull the freshly synthesised (nascent) [RNA](#rna) out of the [RNA](#rna) [polymerase](#polymerase) or cause the release by other mechanisms.
