<a id="strand">Strand</a> - A single [DNA molecule](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) or [RNA](#rna). Such a strand has directionality, typically depicted as going from [5'](#5_prime_end_5) (the end of the strand with the [phosphate group](#phosphateGroup)) to [3'](#3_prime_end_3) (the end of the strand with the -OH group).
