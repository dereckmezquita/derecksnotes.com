<a id="positive_autoregulation">Positive Autoregulation</a> - A regulatory motif where a [gene](#gene) product activates its own production. This motif can exhibit bistability if a [gene](#gene)'s [basal](#Basal) production rate is below its switching threshold. Compared to [negative autoregulation](#negative_autoregulation) a system exhibiting positive autoregulation will take longer to converge to a given steady state.
