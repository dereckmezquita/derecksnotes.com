<a id="southern_blot">Southern Blot</a> - A lab technique used for the detection of specific [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) sequences in a sample. Sothern blotting typically involves a first migration by classic [electrophoresis](#electrophoresis) then a "blotting" step by a membrane which uptakes the [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) from the gell, then the probe which is complementary to the strand of interest is introduced. This probe is typically marked by a radioactive strand or an [antibody](#antibody). This reveals if the sequence of interest was found in the sample or not.
