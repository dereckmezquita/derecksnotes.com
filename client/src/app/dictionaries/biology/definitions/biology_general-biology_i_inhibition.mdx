<a id="inhibition">Inhibition</a> - A [molecule](#molecule) that can cause the arrest or tamper the activity of a reaction is called an inhibitor. In the context of biology an inhibitor has a negative effect on a reaction catalysed by an enzyme. There are multiple cases into which an inhibition may be classed:

    Types of inhibition, the concentration of of the inhibitor is the only thing that changes.

- Competitive inhibition: K<sub>m</sub> increased, V<sub>max</sub> unaffected. The inhibitor matches the active site and fixes itself there.
- Un-competitive inhibition: K<sub>m</sub> reduced, V<sub>max</sub> reduced. The inhibitor matches a zone close to the active site and thus impedes the substrate from fixing itself there.
- Non-competitive: K<sub>m</sub> unaffected, V<sub>max</sub> reduced. The inhibtor fixes itself somewhere else on the enzyme and changes the conformation of the active site.
