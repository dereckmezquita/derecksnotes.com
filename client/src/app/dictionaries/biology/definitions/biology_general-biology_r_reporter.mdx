<a id="reporter">Reporter</a> - In the context of [gene expression](#geneExpression), a reporter allows the easy determination of [transcription](#transcription) from a given [promoter](#promoter). Good reporters have an obvious [phenotype](#phenotype) such as the blue [phenotype](#phenotype) for [LacZ](#lacz) in the presence of [X-gal](#x_gal), or the [fluorescence](#fluorescence) of a [fluorescent protein](#green_fluorescent_protein_gfp_egfp). [Quantification](#quantitative) of [protein](#protein) production from a [promoter](#promoter) as a function of reporter [fluorescence](#fluorescence) is also possible.
