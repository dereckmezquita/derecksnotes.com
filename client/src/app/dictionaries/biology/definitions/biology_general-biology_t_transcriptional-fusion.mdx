<a id="transcriptional_fusion">Transcriptional Fusion</a> - A mechanism for generating several [transcripts](#transcription) from the same input. For example, using the same [promoter](#promoter) for different [genes](#gene) causes all of the [genes](#gene) to be [transcribed](#transcription) if the appropriate input is present. Several [transcripts](#transcription) can sometimes also be produced if processing of a single [transcript](#transcription) creates several, *exempli gratia* if there is a self-[cleaving](#cleavage) [RNA](#rna) element in the [transcript](#transcription). These [transcripts](#transcription) are produced in equal amounts, but can contain different information. See [Translational Fusion](#translational_fusion).
