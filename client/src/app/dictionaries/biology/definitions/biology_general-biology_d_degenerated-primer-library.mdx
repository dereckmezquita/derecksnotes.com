<a id="degenerated_primer_library">Degenerated Primer Library</a> - A degenerate primer library is a mix of primers used in [SELEX](#selex_systematic_evolution_of_ligands_by_exponential_enrichment). These primers are obtained by chemical synthesis; note that in chemistry DNA sequences are generated in the reverse sense, 3' → 5'. These primers should contain common regions and "degenerated regions". These degenerated regions are denoted as N; N meaning any of the 4 nucleotides may occupy that spot. Note that if a sequence is ordered with 40N then that would mean that there are 440 \= 1.2 · 1024 different sequences possible. Note the tube received will contain a mixture of all the different possible sequences and not just specific ones.
