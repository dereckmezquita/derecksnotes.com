<a id="2d_electrophoresis">2D Electrophoresis</a> - A 2D electrophoresis, is a variant of the [electrophoresis](#electrophoresis) lab method. Usually the first [electrophoresis](#electrophoresis) is done to migrate proteins based on their mobility which is dependent on the charge/mass ratio. Then a second migration is done in the other dimension, or perpendicular to the first; now migrating the proteins based on their [potential hydrogen isoelectric point (pHi)](#potential_hydrogen_isoelectric_point_phi). By doing this we can reveal different proteins that might have been hidden all in one band.
