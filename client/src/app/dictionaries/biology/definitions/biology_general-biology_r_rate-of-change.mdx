<a id="rate_of_change">Rate of Change</a> - How much a dependent variable changes for a given change in an independent variable. Graphically, it is the slope of a line where the independent variable is on the x-axis and the dependent variable is on the y. The rate of change at any point can be determined by taking the first derivative of a function with respect to the independent variable.
