<a id="timing_diagram">Timing Diagram</a> - A diagram showing how a system behaves and [evolves](#evolution) over time. For digital systems, a timing diagram shows the state of the system (and possibly signals within the system) at each tick of a clock. Often a timing diagram is depicted as a table, where each row shows a signal and each column shows an instance of time. The value in the table is the value of the particular signal at the particular time. Another way to depict the timing diagram is to draw a value trace over time for each signal and stack them such that time flows left to right.
