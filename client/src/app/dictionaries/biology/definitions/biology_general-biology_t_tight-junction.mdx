<a id="tight_junction">Tight junction</a> - Intercellular structure which forms an almost perfect continuous seal between two adjacent [epithelial cells](#epithelium) close to their [apical](#apical) (side which faces the lumen) side. The tightness of the seal may vary depending on the kind of [epithelium](#epithelium). It acts as a filter which lets water and some other [ions](#ion) come through and into the organism. These tight junctions are also important in halting the [diffusion](#diffusion) of [proteins](#protein) and cytoplasmique glycolipids from the [apical](#apical) side of the [cell](#cell) to the [basolateral](#basolateral) side.
