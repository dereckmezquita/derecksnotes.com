<a id="type_ii_restriction_enzymes">Type II Restriction Enzymes</a> - These [restriction enzymes](#restriction_enzyme) are used to [cleave](#cleavage) double-stranded [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) in a location that is outside the recognition sequence of the [enzyme](#enzyme). They are particularly useful for [DNA assembly](#dna_assembly), as they enable creating arbitrary [overhang](#overhang) sequences. Commonly used Type IIs [enzymes](#enzyme) include BsaI and BbsI, which are both used in [Golden Gate](#golden_gate) or [MoClo assembly](#moclo).
