<a id="ribosome_binding_site_rbs">Ribosome Binding Site (RBS)</a> - A sequence upstream of the start [codon](#codon) that recruits [ribosomes](#ribosome) and allows [translation](#translation). RBSs are well-defined in [prokaryotic](#prokaryote) systems and are also known as Shine-Dalgarno sequences. Recruitment of [ribosomes](#ribosome) in [eukaryotic](#eukaryota) systems is more complex and less-understood. RBS "strength" is a large factor in [protein](#protein) production rate and is determined by local [RNA](#rna) [secondary](#conformation) and [tertiary](#conformation) structure. RBS calculators allow the control of relative [translation](#translation) rates across different RBSs.
