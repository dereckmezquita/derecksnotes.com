<a id="ahl">AHL</a> - They are a class of homoserine lactones with an acyl group. These are small [molecules](#molecule) that can [diffuse](#diffusion) between cells. They typically act as a [quorum sensing](#quorum_sensing) and [signaling molecule](#signal) as it can [diffuse](#diffusion) throughout a [bacterial population](#bacterial_colony) such that the knowledge of the [concentration](#concentration) of the AHL is shared between all [bacteria](#bacteria). The [bacteria](#bacteria) can detect the AHL [concentration](#concentration) by way of a [transcription factor](#transcription_factor_tf) that can bind and be modulated by the AHL molecule. For example, the [LuxI gene](#lux_system_luxi_luxr) produces an AHL that can then bind [LuxR](#lux_system_luxi_luxr), relieving its [repressor](#repressor) on the corresponding [promoter](#promoter).
