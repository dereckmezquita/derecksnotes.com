<a id="selection">Selection</a> - A phenomena by which organisms reproduce differentially; some more than others. This process results in some genotypes/phenotypes dominating a population.

 Selection can be positive (organisms with a trait survive to the next round) or negative (organisms that do not have a trait survive to the next round).

 In a lab setting this can be used as a method for directed evolution typically with bacteria. This approach can be less work than screening, as only the "interesting" organisms survive, rather than all organisms.
