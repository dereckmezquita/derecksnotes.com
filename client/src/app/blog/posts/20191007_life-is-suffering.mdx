## Perspectives on Life

I had an interesting conversation with Emmanuel the other day. We were talking about how one should live their life, and how one should view it. Needless to say, our perspectives diverge: his outlook is optimistic, while mine is pessimistic.

### Emmanuel's View

**Emmanuel's stance:** One should try to have a good outlook on life. If one excludes the possibility of an afterlife or heaven, this only reinforces his thesis. Life is not a means to an end, but an end in itself.

I agreed with this thought. It's coherent with my own worldview and does not violate any of my previously held beliefs. Yes, one should *try* to enjoy life *try* being the key word.

### My View

**My stance:** Even though one may try to enjoy life, I feel that by definition it is suffering. Physicists and scientists generally agree that the universe tends towards entropy, or disorder. Emmanuel agrees with this as well.

I see biology and life as something which requires order to exist. A cell must control its internal environment, compartmentalising various chemicals, molecules, and proteins to live. These are facts of life; of biology. Thus, biology seems to tend in the opposite direction of the universe's natural push towards disorder.

No matter how noble or courageous life's efforts are, the universe will ultimately win. Until we find evidence that escaping entropy and the heat death of the universe is possible, I must maintain my position: **life goes against the grain of the universe, and will lose; life is by definition suffering.**

## Considering Randomness and Entropy

Later, I had another very interesting conversation with Guy. I mentioned this idea to him. He first agreed, then retorted, recalling a previous discussion we had months ago. He does not believe in randomness.

The concept of randomness arises because it seems required for entropy to exist. Without randomness, there could be a state or process by which the universe or a part of it decreases in entropy. This is intriguing because, no matter how hard I tried, I could not logically prove the actual existence of randomness.

I tried invoking the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states we cannot know both the position and momentum of an electron at the same time. But this might just mean something else is happening beyond our observation, not that randomness truly exists.

As Einstein once famously stated (paraphrased):

<Blockquote src='Einstein'>
I cannot believe that God would play dice with the universe.
</Blockquote>

This may be true. Just because a particle's behavior escapes our observation and appears random does not guarantee that randomness is fundamental. If randomness does not truly exist in nature, maybe there is some hope perhaps life can be good after all.
