Yet another insight stemming from a conversation with friends. I was speaking with Guy on the fundamental truths of the universe and human life and purpose. In general, we agree that life is mostly suffering, as I've [previously mentioned](/blog/20191007_life-is-suffering). So note that this framed our discussion; jolly.

We ended up arguing two opposite sides. Him: why live, why try, and why do anything at all? I: why end life, why not shoot high, and why should one try to enjoy life?

He ended up posing a very interesting and rather disturbing question disturbing because I did not know how to answer at first:

## Why be objective?

<Blockquote src='Guy'>
Why be objective at all? We each live in our own bodies, we have no way to actually verify if other peoples have the same experiences we do, there is no reason to be objective when living in a subjective body.

I did not know how to answer and had to think for quite a while. I came up with the following reasoning. I have no idea if this is an original idea, but let's consider it:

If you start the argument from the position that one should be subjective because we live in subjective shells, then one chooses to elevate one's own biology and perspective as the ultimate value. One important goal for an individual is to avoid suffering. This seems true for most living organisms, as suffering (a disagreeable sensation) often signals harm to the body or mind. Life forms generally strive to avoid suffering through any means physical adaptations (shells, claws, teeth) or behavioral changes (social cooperation, tool use, fleeing, or aggression).

Humans, as a group, are social beings. Why so? Evolution suggests it's largely to reduce suffering. Working together makes us stronger than any single individual. Cooperation offers leverage, power, and generally a more comfortable existence. Many cooperative species share this advantage: each individual's effort contributes to the group's overall well-being.

Why is this so critical? Life, after all, is a balancing act eating but not overeating, having a strong immune system without self-harm, applying selective aggression but not to the detriment of the group. Social interaction and cooperation must reconcile conflicting desires and behaviors.

It's a fact that the fundamental goal of life is to reproduce. Aggression can increase reproduction chances, yet an overly aggressive individual harms the social fabric, risking long-term group survival. Selfishness might yield more immediate resources food, shelter, mates but destabilizes the group. Over evolutionary time, it appears species that manage these trade-offs (favoring cooperation over constant conflict) do better.

Yet cooperation is challenging. It can contradict short-term biological imperatives. A mechanism is needed to facilitate it. Conflict among equals—be it over resources or status—can be resolved through force, withdrawal, or compromise. But force is risky and costly. Compromise, meanwhile, allows both sides to partially benefit without severe harm.

Here, objectivity becomes crucial. If each individual only trusts their own subjective view, compromise becomes difficult. Without a common frame of reference, each remains locked in their personal narrative. But if both can acknowledge an external reality—observable patterns, shared facts, consistently verifiable information—then they have a neutral ground for negotiation. Objectivity, in other words, provides a universal point of reference that transcends individual subjective viewpoints, making meaningful compromise possible.

**Conclusion:** By definition, social creatures tend towards objectivity because it helps them align interests, reduce suffering, and foster cooperation. This might explain why humanity and history look favorably upon those who embrace logic and objectivity—philosophers, scientists, engineers—as their work helps us find common ground, ensuring that we can move beyond subjective isolation into a shared understanding of the world.
