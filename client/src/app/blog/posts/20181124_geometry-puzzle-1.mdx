Mathematics often presents puzzles that, at first glance, seem intricate or counterintuitive. One such geometric construction involves a quarter circle and two semicircles, resulting in two regions labelled A and B. Surprisingly, these two areas are equal.

## The Puzzle

- Begin with a quarter circle of radius $R$.
- Inside it, place two semicircles arranged so that they divide the enclosed area into two distinct regions: A and B.

**The Challenge:** Show that the area of region A equals the area of region B.

## Key Geometric Facts

1. The quarter circle has area:
   
   $$
   \text{Area}_{\text{quarter}} = \frac{\pi R^2}{4}.
   $$

2. Each of the two inner curves is a semicircle with radius $r = \frac{R}{\sqrt{2}}$. Each semicircle thus has area:
   
   $$
   \text{Area}_{\text{semicircle}} = \frac{\pi r^2}{2} = \frac{\pi (R^2/2)}{2} = \frac{\pi R^2}{4}.
   $$

3. Consequently, each semicircle has the same area as the quarter circle. The arrangement ensures that when these semicircles overlap and intersect the quarter circle, the leftover regions A and B end up being equal in area.

Intuition: The symmetry and the radii chosen ensure a perfect balance. Although the figure might look complex, the arithmetic of $R$, $r = R/\sqrt{2}$, and the areas of the arcs involved is simple and elegant. Ultimately, we find that A and B must be equal by construction.

## Conclusion

This geometric puzzle highlights how even complex-looking constructions can yield to simple and elegant relationships. The equality of areas A and B follows directly from the choice of radii and the symmetry of the configuration.
