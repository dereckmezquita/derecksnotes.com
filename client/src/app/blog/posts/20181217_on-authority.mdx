I had some interesting thoughts while watching this small documentary on fraud in the art world.

Apparently forgeries are much more common than I ever knew. It puts all of my museum visit into perspective as I've always been in awe of everything that was presented to me; without questioning provenance or authenticity.

It seems that more often than I had thought, museums will either knowingly or unknowingly present false pieces to the public.

Lesson learned; do not trust any authority, and always question everything. This is what it means to be a scientist.

There is however, a practical aspect that one must take into account. How much time and energy can one spend questioning everything. How much should one question? I would not want to "waste" my life trying to demonstrate the fundamentals of science before advancing.

It seems that at some point, and at some level I will have to trust some authorities... which ones?
