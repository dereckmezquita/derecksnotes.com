I made these while living in Angers France. Just of random buildings in the centre. I've greatly come to admire this style of building, although I doubt the level comfort associated to living in such a place would be very high. These drawings were all made using Faber Castel india ink markers. Wonderful tools would definitly recommend trying them.
