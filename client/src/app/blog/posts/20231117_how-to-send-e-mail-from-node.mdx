## Table of contents

In this guide, we'll walk through the process of setting up a mail server on a Linode server, which includes configuring DNS records, installing Postfix and OpenDKIM, and ensuring your server can send emails successfully.

1. Prerequisites
1. A Linode server
1. A domain name (e.g., derecksnotes.com)

## Request SMTP Restrictions Lifted from Linode

Before setting up your mail server, you need to ensure that SMTP restrictions are lifted on your Linode. Here's a template you can use to request this:

```txt
Hello,

I'd like to have SMTP restrictions lifted from my Linode. I plan to use it for sending email verifications and communications for website accounts.

- First and Last Name: [Your Name]
- Organization Name: [Your Organization]
- Use Case: Email verification and communications for website accounts
- Domain Name: derecksnotes.com
- Public Business Information Links: [Your Links]

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

## Set Up DNS/MX Records

Configure DNS and MX records for your domain. This step is crucial for your mail server to function correctly.

- **A Record**
    - Set up an A record in your DNS settings pointing to your Linode's IP address.
        - Name: @
        - Type: A
        - Value: [Your Linode's IP Address]
- **TXT Record**
    - SPF record to prevent spoofing.
        - Name: @
        - Type: TXT
        - Value: v=spf1 a mx ip4:[Your Linode's IP Address] ~all
    - DMARC record to prevent spoofing.
        - Name: _dmarc
        - Type: TXT
        - Value: v=DMARC1; p=none;
    - DKIM record to prevent spoofing; we have to generate this on the server using OpenDKIM.
        - Name: mail._domainkey (or other selector e.g. dkim._domainkey)
        - Type: TXT
        - Value: *GENERATED ON THE SERVER*
- **MX Record**
    - Create an MX record pointing to your mail server.
        - Name: @
        - Type: MX
        - Priority: 10
        - Value: [Your Linode's IP Address]

## Install Postfix and OpenDKIM

SSH into your Linode server and install Postfix and OpenDKIM.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postfix opendkim opendkim-tools
```

## Configure Postfix

Edit `/etc/postfix/main.cf` and make necessary changes:

```txt
myhostname = mail.derecksnotes.com
myorigin = derecksnotes.com # can also point to a file myorigin = /etc/mailname
mydestination = $myhostname, derecksnotes.com, localhost
```

Uncomment and configure the submission section in `/etc/postfix/master.cf`:

```txt
submission inet n - y - - smtpd
  -o syslog_name=postfix/submission
  -o smtpd_tls_security_level=encrypt
  ... (other options)
```

## Configure OpenDKIM

Generate keys and configure OpenDKIM. Add the following in `/etc/opendkim.conf`:

```txt
Domain                  derecksnotes.com
KeyFile                 /etc/mail/dkim.key
Selector                mail
```

Generate the keys:

```bash
opendkim-genkey -t -s mail -d derecksnotes.com
sudo mv mail.private /etc/mail/dkim.key
sudo chown opendkim:opendkim /etc/mail/dkim.key
```

## Update DNS with DKIM Record

Add the DKIM record from mail.txt to your DNS settings as a TXT record:

```bash
cat mail.txt
```

```
mail._domainkey IN      TXT     ( "v=DKIM1; h=sha256; k=rsa; t=y; "
          "p=REDACTED/REDACTED+REDACTED"
          "REDACTED+REDACTED" )  ; ----- DKIM key mail for derecksnotes.com
```

Everything between the two parentheses is the value of the TXT record.

## Test Email Sending

After configuring your server, test sending emails. You can use the mail command or a script like the following Node.js example:

```bash
echo "Test email body" | mail -s "Test Email" -a "From: test@derecksnotes.com" receipient@test.com
```

```ts
import nodemailer from 'nodemailer';

async function main() {
    let transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
        host: 'localhost', // 'derecksnotes.com',  // Replace with your SMTP server address
        port: 25,                 // Common ports are 25, 465 (SSL), 587 (TLS)
        secure: false,             // True for 465, false for other ports
        tls: {
            rejectUnauthorized: false
        }
    });

    let info = await transporter.sendMail({
        from: '"Test Sender" <test@derecksnotes.com>', // Sender address
        to: 'receipient@test.com',                             // List of receivers
        subject: 'Test Email from Node.js',                   // Subject line
        text: 'Hello world?',                                 // Plain text body
        html: '<b>Hello world?</b>'                           // HTML body content
    });

    console.log('Message sent: %s', info.messageId);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```
