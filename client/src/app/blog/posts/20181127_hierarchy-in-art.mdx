For centuries, art has been judged and valued according to shifting cultural, technical, and intellectual standards. In the pre photographic era, the merit of an artwork often rested on its technical complexity, realistic portrayal of the human figure, and fidelity to classical canons. Yesterday, while delving into the history of art, I came across a compelling video by the YouTube channel *Coffee Break*[^1]. The presenter examined how the advent of photography and the rise of abstract movements challenged these long standing metrics. Even so, I remain sceptical of modern art that disregards technical skill in favour of so called conceptual depth.

The creator behind Coffee Break offers commentary on art, politics, economics, and technology. In this particular video, they dissected the origins of what we now recognise as modern and abstract art, highlighting how once rigid standards gave way to more experimental forms. Yet, while these developments may fascinate some viewers, I believe one must first demonstrate mastery of classical technique before venturing into more abstract styles.

## From Traditional Metrics to New Paradigms

Historically, European academies—most notably the French Academy—relied on a codified hierarchy of genres to classify and evaluate artworks. At the apex stood history painting, followed by portraiture, genre scenes, landscapes and animal studies, and finally, still lifes at the bottom. This ranking reflected the belief that certain subjects demanded more complexity and skill, especially those involving the human figure.[^2]

[^2]: The concept of a "hierarchy of genres" was formalised in the 17th and 18th centuries. See: *Harrison, C. & Wood, P. (Eds.) (2003). Art in Theory 1648-1815: An Anthology of Changing Ideas.* Blackwell Publishing.

This hierarchy served as an informal scale of difficulty and, by extension, value. Accurately representing the human form, narrative scenes, and complex emotions required intense training. By contrast, still lifes or simple abstract shapes often lacked that rigorous intellectual and technical challenge. The basic idea: to achieve high artistic merit, you needed to prove your technical prowess first.

## The Disruption of Photography and Emergence of Modernism

The arrival of photography in the 19th century changed everything. Suddenly, mechanical devices could replicate reality effortlessly, undermining the role of painters as faithful recorders of the visible world. Many artists responded by moving away from representation, embracing abstraction and other non traditional methods. Although some hail this as an expansion of artistic possibilities, I find that much modern art neglects the foundational skill that should precede such experiments. Without that baseline technical training, the departure into abstraction can feel hollow.

## Confronting Abstract and Conceptual Art

While the world may celebrate certain modern or abstract pieces, I remain unimpressed by works that lack demonstrable skill. Merely breaking rules or rejecting tradition does not inherently produce compelling art. What earns my respect are modern artists who could first paint, draw, or sculpt with technical mastery before exploring more reductive or symbolic forms. Picasso, for example, had a solid foundation—he was trained classically, and his early works demonstrate remarkable technical skill. This mastery underpins his later, more simplistic styles, granting them credibility. Without that prior demonstration of ability, a piece that looks simplistic merely appears lazy or untrained.

Likewise, Salvador Dali also possessed extraordinary technical prowess, enabling him to inject complexity and depth even into surreal, non traditional imagery. In such cases, technical mastery becomes a launching pad for meaningful innovation.

## Evolving Perspectives on Value and Merit

Though some people now look to abstraction, conceptualism, or minimalism for meaning, I remain unconvinced that these forms inherently deserve the same esteem as classically executed works unless they are backed by demonstrable skill. I believe that an artist must prove themselves capable of the old challenges before being taken seriously in newer, more experimental domains.

There may still be room for a more expansive view of what art can be. But that expansion should not come at the cost of skill. The best artists, past and present, combine impeccable craftsmanship with original vision. Without that foundation, modern approaches often ring hollow.

## Conclusion

The historical hierarchy in art, once defined by representational complexity, reminds us that standards shift over time. While new technologies and changing tastes have encouraged experimentation, there remains a timeless value in mastery. No amount of abstraction justifies an absence of technical competence. Classical art still "kicks ass" because it demanded skill and showed it off proudly.

In the end, while I may have softened slightly to the idea that art can evolve, my core stance remains: the artist should be fully capable of producing exceptional, technically demanding work before they engage in reductive, experimental, or abstract styles. Only then does their break from tradition carry genuine weight.
