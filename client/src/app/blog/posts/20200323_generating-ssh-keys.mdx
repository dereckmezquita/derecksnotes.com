Working with SSH keys is a crucial part of securely accessing remote servers and services, including GitHub repositories. Whether you are on macOS or Linux, having a reliable SSH configuration can save you time and frustration. Below, we will walk through generating SSH keys, securely copying your public key to a server, setting up SSH for GitHub, and exploring how to handle SSH agents so that you are not constantly re-adding keys when you open new terminals.

## System Information and Setup

Before you begin, identify the server or service you want to connect to. For a remote server, you need its domain name or IP address, along with an account username that you can SSH into. For GitHub, you need a GitHub account with SSH keys added to your profile.

**Example:**
```bash
[account-name@login-01 ~]$ uname -a
Linux login-01 X.XX.X-XXX.XX.X.elX.xYY_XX #1 SMP Tue Jun 18 16:35:19 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

## Creating and Storing an SSH Key

On your client machine (your local macOS or Linux machine), you will generate a new SSH key pair. By convention keys should be stored in ~/.ssh/.

Example key generation:

```bash
dereck@dereck-MBP ~ % ssh-keygen -t rsa      
```

```bash
dereck@dereck-MBP .ssh % ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/dereck/.ssh/id_rsa): server-name
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in server-name.
Your public key has been saved in server-name.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256: taEjFHcmTHcmEjwRsT8kEjUgHBvkaGMoFHT8kLUQ dereck@dereck-MBP
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|O*+    o*.+.o .  |
|o*.  . o.*oOo. + |
|O*+   = +  o*.+ +|
|o. . o o  oo.o = |
| E      S . . .  |
|      o*.+ +     |
|            .   +|
|      o      . o |
|   .   +      o  |
+----[SHA256]-----+
dereck@dereck-MBP .ssh % ls
dereck_id_rsa  config   server-name
dereck_id_rsa.pub known_hosts  server-name.pub
dereck@dereck-MBP .ssh % 
```

In this directory, you now have server-name (your private key) and server-name.pub (your public key).

## Sending the Public Key to a Remote Server

To allow SSH without passwords, copy your public key to the server. On macOS, you can install ssh-copy-id via brew install ssh-copy-id. For Linux, it may be available by default or through your package manager.

Example:

```bash
dereck@dereck-MBP ~ % ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/server-name.pub account-name@domain-or-ip.com
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/Users/dereck/.ssh/server-name.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
account-name@domain-or-ip.com's password: 

Number of key(s) added:        1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'account-name@domain-or-ip.com'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

dereck@dereck-MBP ~ % 
```

If you do not specify -i, SSH defaults to ~/.ssh/id_rsa or keys defined in ~/.ssh/config.

## Automatically Logging Into a Remote Server

If you find yourself SSH'ing into the same server often, you can create a small .command file that launches an SSH session. For instance:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
ssh account-name@domain-or-ip.com -i ~/.ssh/server-name
```

Save this as connect-to-server.command. Make the file executable:

```bash
chmod u+x connect-to-server.command
```

Now you can double-click this file on macOS to quickly open an SSH session.

## Managing SSH Keys for GitHub

If you use GitHub and want to clone private repositories via SSH, add your public key to your GitHub account under Settings > SSH and GPG keys. Once added, you can clone repositories:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YourUserName/YourRepo.git
```

Make sure GitHub knows about your key. If necessary, run:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/server-name -T git@github.com
```

You should see a greeting message if it succeeds.

## Handling SSH Agents and Avoiding Constant Key Re-Addition

A common annoyance is that after opening a new terminal session, your SSH keys are not automatically loaded by the SSH agent. You try to clone a repository or SSH into a server and get an “unauthorised” error because the agent does not know about your keys.

Quick Fix:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/server-name
```

Doing this every time is tedious. Some users add these lines to their ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/server-name
```

However, this may spawn multiple SSH agent processes across different terminals.

More Elegant Solution Using Keychain (Linux):

1. Install keychain (e.g., sudo apt-get install keychain on Debian/Ubuntu).
2. In your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`, add:

```bash
eval $(keychain --eval --agents ssh ~/.ssh/server-name)
```

3. Open a new terminal, and your key should be automatically loaded just once per login session.

On macOS:

You can integrate SSH keys with the built-in Keychain:

```bash
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/server-name
```

The Keychain will remember the passphrase, so you don't have to re-add it each time you open a new terminal.

## Fixing Permissions

If SSH is still not working, ensure that the permissions on your private key are correct:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/server-name
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
```

These permissions help maintain the security and integrity of your SSH keys.

By following these steps and best practices, you can streamline your SSH workflow, minimise re-entering passphrases, and ensure secure, hassle-free logins to both remote servers and GitHub repositories.
