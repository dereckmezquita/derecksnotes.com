## Table of contents

Membranes can be seen as solutions with two dimensions, they are made by a lipid bilayer and contain membranary proteins. Thus a lipid bilayer can be seen as the solvant for membranary proteins.

## Movements of lipids

It is possible for molecules in the lipid bilayer to move in two dimensions generally, this is known as lateral diffusion. But movement in other dimensions is also possible, listed below:

2. Oscillation flex in acyl groups
3. Rotational movement
4. Lateral diffusion
5. Transversal diffusion "flip-flop"
