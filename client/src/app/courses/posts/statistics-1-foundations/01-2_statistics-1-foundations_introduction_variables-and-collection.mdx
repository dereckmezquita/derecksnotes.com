## 1.3 Types of Variables

Variables are characteristics that vary among individuals in a study. Understanding variable types is essential because the appropriate analysis depends critically on what type of data we have. Choose the wrong analysis for your variable type and your conclusions will be meaningless at best, actively misleading at worst.

### 1.3.1 Quantitative Variables

**Quantitative variables** represent numerical measurements or counts. They answer "how much?" or "how many?"

Quantitative variables subdivide into two types:

**Continuous variables** can take any value within a range. Height, weight, blood pressure, and temperature are continuous; between any two values, infinitely many other values are possible. A patient's weight might be 72.3 kg, 72.31 kg, or 72.314159 kg, limited only by measurement precision.

**Discrete variables** can take only specific values, typically integers. Number of children, number of hospitalisations, and number of mutations are discrete; you cannot have 2.7 children. Some discrete variables can take many values (age in years ranges from 0 to ~120), whilst others have few (number of arms is typically 0, 1, or 2).
