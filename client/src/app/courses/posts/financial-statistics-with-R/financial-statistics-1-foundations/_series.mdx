## Preface

This first volume in the Algorithmic Trading with R series establishes the rigorous foundations required to build and evaluate systematic trading strategies. We begin with financial data—understanding market microstructure, return calculations, and the statistical properties that make financial time series unique.

By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of:

- Market structure and how prices form
- Return calculations and their mathematical properties
- Risk and performance metrics used by practitioners
- Building backtesting systems from scratch
- Identifying and avoiding common backtesting biases
- Position sizing and money management techniques

This foundation prepares you for the subsequent courses on technical indicators, factor models, machine learning applications, and live trading systems.

Throughout this course, we use real market data from sources such as Yahoo Finance, Fama-French factor data, and simulated trading scenarios to ground abstract concepts in practical applications.

## Pedagogical Approach

Every concept in this course is presented using a **four-part teaching method**:

### 1. Prose and Intuition

First, we explain the concept in plain language with analogies, examples, and context. We answer: What is this? Why does it matter? When would you use it? We build intuition before introducing any formalism.

### 2. Visual Evidence

Second, we demonstrate the concept visually. Graphs, simulations, and empirical analysis help you *see* what's happening. Visualisation bridges the gap between intuition and mathematics.

### 3. Mathematical Derivation

Third, we present the formal mathematics. We don't simply state formulae—we _derive_ them. We show how the formula was discovered, why it takes the form it does, and what each component means. You will understand not just *what* to compute, but *why* the computation works.

### 4. Implementation and Application

Fourth, we implement everything in R from scratch. We build our own backtesting engine, write our own performance metrics, and create production-quality code. Only after understanding the fundamentals do we discuss library alternatives.

## Prerequisites

This course assumes familiarity with R programming, basic statistics (probability, regression), and familiarity with financial markets. Each chapter concludes with a **Quick Reference** section summarising key formulae and code.

## Code Style

Throughout this course, we follow consistent coding conventions:

- **`box::use()`** for module imports (isolates namespace)
- **`data.table`** for all data manipulation (never tidyverse)
- **`ggplot2`** for visualisation
- **Build from scratch first**, then use libraries

This approach ensures you understand what the libraries are doing under the hood.
