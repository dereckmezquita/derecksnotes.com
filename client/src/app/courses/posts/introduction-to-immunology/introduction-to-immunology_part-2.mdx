## Part II: Innate Immunity

### 3. First Line Defences

#### 3.1 Epithelial Barriers: Structure and Defence Functions

The body's first line of defence against infection consists of physical and chemical barriers that prevent microbial invasion.

**Skin: The Body's Largest Immune Organ**
Human skin provides a formidable barrier against environmental threats:

1. **Structural Features**:
   - **Stratum corneum**: Outermost layer composed of dead keratinocytes filled with keratin, creating a water-resistant, physical barrier
   - **Tight junctions**: Connect adjacent epithelial cells to prevent paracellular microbial passage
   - **Constant renewal**: Continuous shedding of superficial cells (desquamation) removes adherent microorganisms

2. **Biochemical Defences**:
   - **Acidic environment**: Skin surface pH of 4.5-5.5 inhibits growth of many pathogens
   - **Sebum production**: Contains antimicrobial free fatty acids and lactic acid
   - **Sweat components**: Dermicidin and other antimicrobial peptides provide broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity

3. **Commensal Microbiota**:
   - Occupies ecological niches, preventing colonisation by pathogens
   - Produces antimicrobial substances that inhibit pathogen growth
   - Competes for nutrients and attachment sites
   - Educates and regulates immune responses

**Mucosal Barriers**
Mucosal surfaces line the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts, representing vast interfaces with the external environment:

1. **Respiratory Tract Defences**:
   - **Mucociliary escalator**: Coordinated ciliary beating propels mucus and trapped particles toward the pharynx for expectoration or swallowing
   - **Goblet cells**: Secrete mucin glycoproteins that hydrate to form mucus, trapping particles and microbes
   - **Antimicrobial proteins**: Lysozyme, lactoferrin, and defensins in airway surface liquid
   - **Resident alveolar macrophages**: Patrol and clear microbes that reach the alveoli

2. **Gastrointestinal Tract Defences**:
   - **Peristalsis**: Propulsive movements prevent microbial colonisation
   - **Mucus layers**: Dual-layered protection in the colon (dense inner layer largely devoid of bacteria, looser outer layer with commensal microbes)
   - **Gastric acid**: Maintains pH 1.5-3.5 in the stomach, destroying many ingested microorganisms
   - **Bile salts**: Disrupt bacterial membranes
   - **Pancreatic enzymes**: Degrade microbial components
   - **Intestinal microbiome**: Approximately 10<sup>14</sup> microorganisms providing colonisation resistance

3. **Urogenital Tract Defences**:
   - **Urine flow**: Mechanically flushes out microbes
   - **Acidic pH**: Vaginal lactic acid (from Lactobacillus species) creates an inhospitable environment for many pathogens
   - **Cyclic changes**: Hormonal regulation of vaginal epithelium and secretions

**Specialised Barriers**
Certain body sites employ unique protective mechanisms:

1. **Ocular Surface**:
   - **Tears**: Contain lysozyme, lactoferrin, and secretory IgA
   - **Blinking**: Physically removes potential pathogens
   - **Conjunctival-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT)**: Provides immune surveillance

2. **Blood-Brain Barrier**:
   - Highly selective tight junctions between endothelial cells
   - Regulated transport systems
   - Specialised resident microglia with immune surveillance functions

**Clinical Relevance of Barrier Dysfunction**
Disruption of epithelial barriers is associated with multiple pathologies:

1. **Atopic dermatitis**: Filaggrin mutations compromise skin barrier function
2. **Inflammatory bowel diseases**: Defective mucosal barrier with increased intestinal permeability
3. **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**: Impaired mucociliary clearance
4. **Cystic fibrosis**: Defective CFTR protein leads to dehydrated mucus and recurrent infections

#### 3.2 Antimicrobial Peptides and Proteins

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are evolutionarily ancient effector molecules that provide broad-spectrum defence against microbial threats.

**Characteristics and Classification**
AMPs exhibit remarkable diversity in structure and mechanisms:

1. **General Features**:
   - Small size (typically 12-50 amino acids)
   - Cationic (positively charged) at physiological pH
   - Amphipathic structure (both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains)
   - Broad-spectrum activity against bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites
   - Rapid mechanism of action, often targeting microbial membranes
   - Low propensity for resistance development

2. **Structural Classification**:
   - **α-helical peptides**: Linear structures forming helices in membrane environments (e.g., LL-37, magainins)
   - **β-sheet peptides**: Stabilised by disulphide bridges (e.g., human defensins)
   - **Extended/flexible peptides**: Rich in specific amino acids like histidine, glycine, or proline (e.g., histatins, indolicidin)
   - **Loop peptides**: Containing a single disulphide bond (e.g., thanatin)

**Major Human Antimicrobial Peptides**

1. **Defensins**:
   - **α-defensins**: Produced by neutrophils (HNP1-4) and Paneth cells (HD5, HD6)
   - **β-defensins**: Expressed by epithelial cells at mucosal surfaces
   - Contain three intramolecular disulphide bonds
   - Mechanism: Form pores in microbial membranes and permeabilise bacteria

2. **Cathelicidins**:
   - Single human cathelicidin (LL-37) derived from precursor hCAP18
   - Produced by neutrophils, macrophages, and epithelial cells
   - Multifunctional: antimicrobial, chemotactic, and immunomodulatory roles
   - Mechanism: Carpet-like membrane disruption

3. **Histatins**:
   - Histidine-rich peptides found in saliva
   - Target fungal pathogens, particularly Candida species
   - Mechanism: Mitochondrial targeting and energy depletion

**Larger Antimicrobial Proteins**

1. **Lysozyme**:
   - Abundant in secretions including tears, saliva, and breast milk
   - Cleaves peptidoglycan cell walls by hydrolysing β-(1,4) glycosidic bonds
   - Particularly effective against gram-positive bacteria

2. **Lactoferrin**:
   - Iron-binding glycoprotein found in various secretions
   - Mechanism: Sequesters iron essential for microbial growth
   - Additional direct antimicrobial activity through lactoferricin domain

3. **Complement-Derived AMPs**:
   - C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins exhibit direct antimicrobial properties
   - Mechanism: Membrane disruption independent of their inflammatory functions

4. **Bactericidal/Permeability-Increasing Protein (BPI)**:
   - Stored in neutrophil granules
   - Potent activity against gram-negative bacteria
   - Mechanism: Binds and neutralises lipopolysaccharide (LPS)

**Mechanisms of Antimicrobial Action**
AMPs employ diverse strategies to kill microorganisms:

1. **Membrane Disruption Models**:
   - **Barrel-stave model**: Peptides insert perpendicularly, forming transmembrane pores
   - **Toroidal pore model**: Peptides induce membrane curvature, forming mixed lipid-peptide pores
   - **Carpet model**: Peptides accumulate parallel to membrane surface, causing detergent-like disruption

2. **Intracellular Targets**:
   - Inhibition of DNA, RNA, or protein synthesis
   - Disruption of enzymatic activity
   - Interference with cell wall synthesis
   - Inhibition of mitochondrial function

**Immunomodulatory Functions**
Beyond direct killing, AMPs regulate immune responses:

1. **Chemotaxis**: Recruit neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells to infection sites
2. **Modulation of cytokine production**: Influence pro- and anti-inflammatory responses
3. **Enhancement of phagocytosis**: Opsonise microbes and enhance clearance
4. **Promotion of wound healing**: Stimulate epithelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis
5. **Linking innate and adaptive immunity**: Influence dendritic cell maturation and antigen presentation

**Regulation and Induction**
AMP expression is tightly regulated and can be induced by:

1. **Microbial products**: LPS, flagellin, and other PAMPs via TLR signalling
2. **Inflammatory cytokines**: IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-17
3. **Injury signals**: Tissue damage and wound healing responses
4. **Vitamin D**: Upregulates cathelicidin production (linking sunlight exposure to antimicrobial defence)

**Clinical Significance and Therapeutic Potential**
AMPs are increasingly recognised for their role in disease and therapeutic applications:

1. **Disease Associations**:
   - **Crohn's disease**: Reduced α-defensin production by Paneth cells
   - **Atopic dermatitis**: Reduced expression of LL-37 and β-defensins
   - **Cystic fibrosis**: Salt-sensitive inactivation of AMPs in airway fluid

2. **Therapeutic Development**:
   - **Synthetic AMP derivatives**: Modified for increased stability and reduced toxicity
   - **AMP inducers**: Compounds that stimulate endogenous AMP production
   - **Combination therapies**: AMPs with conventional antibiotics for synergistic effects

#### 3.3 The Complement System

The complement system represents a sophisticated network of plasma proteins that function in a cascade-like manner to eliminate pathogens and coordinate immune responses.

**Overview and Historical Context**
Discovered in the 1890s as a heat-labile component of serum that "complemented" antibodies in killing bacteria, the complement system comprises over 30 soluble and membrane-bound proteins. It forms one of the oldest innate immune mechanisms, with components identified across the animal kingdom from invertebrates to mammals.

**Activation Pathways**
The complement cascade can be initiated through three distinct pathways, all converging at C3 activation:

1. **Classical Pathway**:
   - **Initiating factor**: Antigen-antibody complexes (primarily IgM and IgG)
   - **Recognition component**: C1q binds to Fc regions of clustered antibodies
   - **Activation sequence**: C1q → C1r → C1s → C4 → C2 → C4b2a (C3 convertase)
   - **Regulation**: C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) prevents spontaneous activation

2. **Alternative Pathway**:
   - **Initiating factor**: Spontaneous low-level hydrolysis of C3 ("tick-over")
   - **Amplification**: Microbial surfaces lack regulatory proteins, allowing C3b deposition
   - **Activation sequence**: C3 (hydrolysed) → Factor B → Factor D → C3bBb (C3 convertase)
   - **Stabilisation**: Properdin (Factor P) stabilises the C3 convertase
   - **Regulation**: Factors H and I control amplification on host cells

3. **Lectin Pathway**:
   - **Initiating factors**: Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolins
   - **Recognition targets**: Carbohydrate patterns on microbial surfaces
   - **Activation sequence**: MBL/ficolins → MASP-1/MASP-2 → C4 → C2 → C4b2a (C3 convertase)
   - **Regulation**: Similar to classical pathway regulation

**The Central Component: C3**
C3 occupies a pivotal position in the complement cascade:

1. **Structure and Activation**:
   - Large protein (185 kDa) composed of α and β chains
   - Contains an internal thioester bond in the α chain
   - Cleavage by C3 convertase generates C3a and C3b
   - Exposed thioester in C3b forms covalent bonds with nearby surfaces

2. **C3 Fragments and Functions**:
   - **C3b**: Major opsonin; forms part of C5 convertase
   - **iC3b**: Degradation product of C3b; ligand for CR3 and CR4
   - **C3d**: Terminal degradation fragment; enhances B cell responses via CR2
   - **C3a**: Anaphylatoxin; promotes inflammation

**Terminal Pathway and Membrane Attack Complex (MAC)**
The terminal pathway leads to direct lysis of target cells:

1. **Initiation**:
   - C5 convertase (C4b2a3b or C3bBb3b) cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b
   - C5a acts as a potent anaphylatoxin and chemoattractant
   - C5b initiates the assembly of the terminal components

2. **MAC Formation**:
   - Sequential addition: C5b → C6 → C7 → C8 → multiple C9 molecules
   - C5b-7 complex inserts into membrane
   - C8 and polymerised C9 form a transmembrane pore (10nm diameter)
   - Result: Osmotic lysis of targeted cell

3. **Resistance Mechanisms**:
   - Gram-positive bacteria: Thick peptidoglycan layer prevents MAC access to membrane
   - Some gram-negative bacteria: Modify outer membrane structure
   - Parasites: Express surface molecules that inhibit MAC formation

**Biological Functions of Complement**
The complement system serves multiple roles in immunity:

1. **Pathogen Elimination**:
   - **Direct lysis**: MAC-mediated killing of gram-negative bacteria and enveloped viruses
   - **Opsonisation**: Enhanced phagocytosis via complement receptors (CR1, CR3, CR4)
   - **Immune complex clearance**: CR1 on erythrocytes transports complexes to liver/spleen

2. **Inflammatory Response Coordination**:
   - **Anaphylatoxins** (C3a, C5a): Induce degranulation of mast cells and basophils
   - **Chemotaxis**: C5a directs neutrophil migration to infection sites
   - **Vascular effects**: Increased permeability facilitates immune cell extravasation

3. **Interface with Adaptive Immunity**:
   - **Enhancement of antibody responses**: C3d acts as a molecular adjuvant
   - **Augmentation of T cell immunity**: Complement receptors on APCs enhance antigen presentation
   - **Influence on immunological memory**: Complement shapes the quality of adaptive responses

**Regulation of Complement Activation**
Tight regulation prevents inappropriate activation and host tissue damage:

1. **Soluble Regulators**:
   - **C1 inhibitor**: Prevents spontaneous classical pathway activation
   - **Factor H**: Accelerates C3 convertase decay; cofactor for Factor I
   - **Factor I**: Cleaves and inactivates C3b and C4b
   - **C4-binding protein**: Regulates classical and lectin pathway convertases
   - **Vitronectin and clusterin**: Prevent inappropriate MAC formation

2. **Membrane-Bound Regulators**:
   - **CD35 (CR1)**: Decay-accelerating activity for convertases; cofactor for Factor I
   - **CD46 (MCP)**: Cofactor for Factor I-mediated C3b/C4b cleavage
   - **CD55 (DAF)**: Accelerates convertase decay
   - **CD59 (protectin)**: Prevents C9 polymerisation and MAC formation

**Complement in Disease**
Dysregulation of complement contributes to numerous pathologies:

1. **Deficiencies**:
   - **C3 deficiency**: Recurrent pyogenic infections
   - **Terminal component deficiencies (C5-C9)**: Susceptibility to Neisseria infections
   - **Mannose-binding lectin deficiency**: Increased risk of infections in early childhood

2. **Excessive Activation**:
   - **Autoimmune conditions**: SLE (defective clearance of immune complexes)
   - **Ischaemia-reperfusion injury**: Tissue damage following restoration of blood flow
   - **Age-related macular degeneration**: Polymorphisms in Factor H

3. **Genetic Disorders**:
   - **Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria**: Deficiency of GPI-anchored regulators
   - **Hereditary angioedema**: C1 inhibitor deficiency
   - **Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome**: Mutations in regulatory proteins

**Therapeutic Targeting of Complement**
Emerging therapeutic strategies aim to modulate complement activity:

1. **Inhibitory Approaches**:
   - **C1 inhibition**: Recombinant C1-INH for hereditary angioedema
   - **Anti-C5 antibodies**: Eculizumab for PNH and aHUS
   - **Compstatin derivatives**: C3 inhibitors in clinical development

2. **Enhancing Strategies**:
   - **Complement-activating antibodies**: Enhanced tumour cell killing
   - **Vaccination adjuvants**: Targeting complement receptors

#### 3.4 Acute Phase Response and Inflammation

Inflammation represents a coordinated response to infection or tissue damage, while the acute phase response comprises systemic adaptations that support host defence during inflammatory challenges.

**The Inflammatory Response: Local Tissue Reactions**
Inflammation is characterised by the cardinal signs described by Celsus in the 1st century CE: *rubor* (redness), *calor* (heat), *dolor* (pain), *tumor* (swelling), and later added *functio laesa* (loss of function).

1. **Initiating Signals**:
   - **PAMPs**: Microbial structures recognised by pattern recognition receptors
   - **DAMPs**: Endogenous molecules released from damaged cells (e.g., ATP, HMGB1, heat shock proteins)
   - **Alarmins**: Constitutively expressed proteins released during cell death (e.g., IL-33, IL-1α)

2. **Vascular Changes**:
   - **Early vasoconstriction**: Brief period (seconds) that limits blood loss
   - **Vasodilation**: Mediated by histamine, prostaglandins, and nitric oxide
   - **Increased vascular permeability**: Formation of protein-rich exudate
   - **Endothelial activation**: Upregulation of adhesion molecules (selectins, ICAMs, VCAMs)

3. **Cellular Recruitment and Activation**:
   - **Neutrophils**: First cells to arrive (within hours)
   - **Monocytes/macrophages**: Appear later (24-48 hours)
   - **Dendritic cells**: Capture antigens for presentation
   - **Lymphocytes**: Recruited during later stages in complex infections

4. **Molecular Mediators**:
   - **Pre-formed mediators**: Histamine, serotonin from mast cells and platelets
   - **Newly synthesised lipid mediators**: Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, PAF
   - **Cytokines**: IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17
   - **Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species**: Produced by activated phagocytes
   - **Complement fragments**: C3a, C5a (anaphylatoxins)

**The Acute Phase Response: Systemic Adaptations**
The acute phase response represents coordinated systemic changes induced by inflammatory mediators (particularly IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α) acting on distant organs:

1. **Metabolic Alterations**:
   - **Fever**: Reset hypothalamic thermostat (beneficial for immune function)
   - **Anorexia**: Reduced food intake (limits nutrients for pathogens)
   - **Muscle catabolism**: Provides amino acids for gluconeogenesis and acute phase protein synthesis
   - **Altered iron metabolism**: Hypoferraemia limits iron availability for pathogens

2. **Acute Phase Proteins (APPs)**:
   - **C-reactive protein (CRP)**: Binds phosphocholine on microbial surfaces, activates complement
   - **Serum amyloid A (SAA)**: Lipid metabolism, chemotaxis
   - **Fibrinogen**: Coagulation factor, increases blood viscosity
   - **Ferritin**: Sequesters iron
   - **α₁-Antitrypsin**: Protects tissues from neutrophil elastase
   - **Haptoglobin**: Binds free haemoglobin
   - **Mannose-binding lectin**: Pattern recognition, complement activation

3. **Haematological Changes**:
   - **Neutrophilia**: Increased neutrophil production and release
   - **Thrombocytosis**: Elevated platelet count
   - **Anaemia of inflammation**: Reduced erythropoiesis

4. **Neuroendocrine Adjustments**:
   - **HPA axis activation**: Increased cortisol production
   - **Sympathetic nervous system activation**: Catecholamine release
   - **Behavioural adaptations**: Lethargy, social withdrawal (conserves energy)

**Resolution of Inflammation**
Rather than passive cessation, inflammation resolves through active processes:

1. **Lipid Mediator Class Switching**:
   - Shift from pro-inflammatory prostaglandins to pro-resolving mediators
   - **Specialised pro-resolving mediators (SPMs)**: Lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, maresins

2. **Cellular Mechanisms**:
   - **Neutrophil apoptosis**: Programmed cell death prevents release of harmful contents
   - **Efferocytosis**: Clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages
   - **M1 → M2 macrophage phenotype shift**: From pro-inflammatory to repair-promoting

3. **Anti-inflammatory Cytokines**:
   - IL-10, TGF-β: Suppress ongoing inflammation
   - IL-1 receptor antagonist: Blocks IL-1 signalling

4. **Tissue Repair**:
   - Fibroblast activation and proliferation
   - Angiogenesis
   - Extracellular matrix remodelling

**Chronic Inflammation**
When resolution fails, inflammation can become chronic, contributing to numerous diseases:

1. **Persistent Stimuli**:
   - **Infections**: Tuberculosis, hepatitis, HIV
   - **Foreign bodies**: Silica, asbestos
   - **Autoimmunity**: Self-antigens driving ongoing responses

2. **Cellular Composition**:
   - Predominance of monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes
   - Granuloma formation in some cases
   - Tissue fibrosis

3. **Molecular Signature**:
   - Persistent cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6)
   - Oxidative stress and tissue damage
   - Impaired resolution mechanisms

4. **Disease Associations**:
   - **Atherosclerosis**: Chronic inflammation of arterial walls
   - **Type 2 diabetes**: Low-grade systemic inflammation
   - **Neurodegenerative diseases**: Neuroinflammation
   - **Cancer**: Tumour-promoting inflammation

**Clinical Applications**
Understanding inflammation has led to numerous therapeutic approaches:

1. **Biomarkers**:
   - **CRP**: Widely used marker of systemic inflammation
   - **Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)**: Non-specific indicator
   - **Procalcitonin**: More specific for bacterial infections

2. **Anti-inflammatory Therapies**:
   - **NSAIDs**: Inhibit cyclooxygenase enzymes
   - **Corticosteroids**: Broad anti-inflammatory effects
   - **Targeted biologics**: Anti-TNF, anti-IL-1, anti-IL-6 antibodies
   - **Pro-resolving approaches**: Specialised lipid mediator analogues

### 4. Cellular Components of Innate Immunity

#### 4.1 Phagocytes: Neutrophils, Macrophages, and Dendritic Cells

Phagocytic cells represent a crucial arm of innate immunity, responsible for recognising, engulfing, and destroying microbial invaders.

**Neutrophils: The First Responders**
Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes in human blood and typically the first cells to arrive at sites of infection.

1. **Development and Kinetics**:
   - Develop in bone marrow from myeloid progenitors
   - Production rate: ~10<sup>11</sup> cells/day in humans
   - Short-lived: 5-8 hours in circulation, 1-2 days in tissues
   - Bone marrow reserve allows rapid mobilisation during infection

2. **Morphology and Granules**:
   - Multilobed nucleus (typically 3-5 lobes)
   - Three types of granules containing antimicrobial components:
     - **Primary (azurophilic) granules**: Myeloperoxidase, defensins, cathepsins, elastase
     - **Secondary (specific) granules**: Lactoferrin, lysozyme, NADPH oxidase components
     - **Tertiary granules**: Gelatinase, matrix metalloproteinases
   - **Secretory vesicles**: Complement receptors, integrins for rapid deployment

3. **Neutrophil Recruitment and Extravasation**:
   - **Margination**: Rolling along activated endothelium via selectins
   - **Activation**: Integrin conformational change triggered by chemokines
   - **Firm adhesion**: Binding to endothelial ICAMs via LFA-1 and Mac-1
   - **Transmigration**: Passage between or through endothelial cells
   - **Chemotaxis**: Directed migration following chemokine gradients (IL-8, C5a, LTB4)

4. **Antimicrobial Mechanisms**:
   - **Phagocytosis**: Recognition and internalisation of opsonised particles
   - **Oxidative burst**: Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via NADPH oxidase
     - Superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup>) → hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) → hypochlorous acid (HOCl)
   - **Degranulation**: Release of antimicrobial granule contents
   - **Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)**: Expulsion of decondensed chromatin decorated with antimicrobial proteins

5. **Disease Associations**:
   - **Neutropenia**: Increased susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections
   - **Chronic granulomatous disease**: Defective NADPH oxidase → recurrent infections
   - **Leukocyte adhesion deficiency**: Impaired extravasation → recurrent infections
   - **Cystic fibrosis**: Dysregulated neutrophil function → lung damage

**Monocytes and Macrophages: Versatile Tissue Sentinels**
Macrophages are tissue-resident professional phagocytes derived primarily from circulating monocytes, though some populations arise from embryonic precursors and self-maintain.

1. **Monocyte Subsets and Recruitment**:
   - **Classical monocytes**: CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>−</sup> in humans; inflammatory functions
   - **Non-classical monocytes**: CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>++</sup>; patrol vasculature
   - **Intermediate monocytes**: CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>; features of both subsets
   - Recruitment follows similar steps as neutrophils but with different chemokine receptors (CCR2, CX3CR1)

2. **Tissue-Resident Macrophage Diversity**:
   - **Microglia**: Central nervous system
   - **Kupffer cells**: Liver
   - **Alveolar macrophages**: Lungs
   - **Osteoclasts**: Bone
   - **Histiocytes**: Connective tissue
   - Each population expresses distinct transcriptional profiles adapted to their tissue environment

3. **Pattern Recognition and Phagocytosis**:
   - Express numerous PRRs (TLRs, NLRs, CLRs)
   - **Direct recognition**: Via PRRs binding to PAMPs
   - **Opsonin-mediated uptake**: Fc receptors (FcγRI, FcγRII, FcγRIII) and complement receptors (CR1, CR3, CR4)
   - **Apoptotic cell recognition**: Phosphatidylserine receptors, thrombospondin receptors

4. **Phagosome Maturation and Pathogen Killing**:
   - **Early phagosome**: Rapid acidification (pH ~6.5)
   - **Late phagosome**: Further acidification (pH ~5.5), acquisition of hydrolytic enzymes
   - **Phagolysosome**: Terminal compartment (pH ~4.5) where killing occurs through:
     - Acid hydrolases
     - Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species
     - Antimicrobial peptides
     - Nutrient sequestration (iron, zinc)

5. **Macrophage Polarisation**:
   - **M1 (classically activated)**: Induced by IFN-γ, LPS; pro-inflammatory functions
   - **M2 (alternatively activated)**: Induced by IL-4, IL-13; tissue repair, parasite control
   - Represents extremes of a spectrum rather than discrete entities
   - Remarkable plasticity allows adaptation to changing environments

6. **Functions Beyond Phagocytosis**:
   - **Antigen presentation**: Less efficient than dendritic cells but important in certain contexts
   - **Cytokine production**: TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-10
   - **Tissue repair and remodelling**: Production of growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases
   - **Iron homeostasis**: Recycling of iron from senescent erythrocytes
   - **Lipid metabolism**: Uptake of modified lipoproteins

**Dendritic Cells: Professional Antigen Presenters**
Dendritic cells (DCs) serve as the primary link between innate and adaptive immunity, specialising in antigen capture, processing, and presentation.

1. **Dendritic Cell Subsets**:
   - **Conventional/Classical DCs (cDCs)**:
     - **cDC1**: Superior cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells; express XCR1, CLEC9A
     - **cDC2**: Efficient MHC II presentation to CD4+ T cells; express CD11b, SIRPA
   - **Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs)**: Specialised in antiviral responses via type I interferon production
   - **Monocyte-derived DCs**: Differentiate from monocytes during inflammation
   - **Langerhans cells**: Epidermal DCs with unique features (Birbeck granules)

2. **Life Cycle**:
   - **Immature state**: Reside in peripheral tissues; highly endocytic
   - **Maturation**: Triggered by PRR signalling or inflammatory cytokines
   - **Migration**: Travel via lymphatics to secondary lymphoid organs
   - **Interaction with T cells**: Present processed antigens in T cell zones

3. **Antigen Processing Pathways**:
   - **MHC I pathway**: Present endogenous antigens to CD8+ T cells
   - **MHC II pathway**: Present exogenous antigens to CD4+ T cells
   - **Cross-presentation**: Present exogenous antigens on MHC I molecules
   - **CD1 pathway**: Present lipid antigens to NKT cells

4. **Maturation-Associated Changes**:
   - Decreased endocytic capacity
   - Increased MHC and costimulatory molecule expression (CD80, CD86, CD40)
   - Cytoskeletal reorganisation (loss of adhesive structures, acquisition of cellular projections)
   - Altered chemokine receptor expression (↓CCR6, ↑CCR7)
   - Production of cytokines that shape T cell responses

5. **Functional Specialisation**:
   - **Induction of immunity**: Against pathogens and cancers
   - **Tolerance induction**: To self-antigens and commensal microbes
   - **Polarisation of T cells**: Influence Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg differentiation
   - **Interaction with innate lymphocytes**: Activate NK cells via IL-12, IL-15

6. **Therapeutic Applications**:
   - **DC vaccines**: Ex vivo loaded with tumour antigens for cancer immunotherapy
   - **DC targeting**: In vivo targeting of antigens to specific DC receptors
   - **Adjuvants**: TLR ligands enhance DC activation and improve vaccine responses

#### 4.2 Natural Killer Cells

Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that provide crucial early defence against viral infections and cancer, operating without the need for prior sensitisation.

**Development and Subsets**
NK cells develop primarily in the bone marrow from common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs).

1. **Developmental Stages**:
   - CLP → NK precursors → immature NK cells → mature NK cells
   - Key transcription factors: Ets-1, T-bet, Eomes
   - Cytokines essential for development: IL-15, IL-7, Flt3L

2. **Human NK Cell Subsets**:
   - **CD56<sup>bright</sup>CD16<sup>−</sup>**: ~10% of peripheral blood NK cells
     - Predominant in secondary lymphoid tissues
     - High cytokine production capacity
     - Lower cytotoxic potential
   - **CD56<sup>dim</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>**: ~90% of peripheral blood NK cells
     - More cytotoxic
     - Express higher levels of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs)
     - Predominant in peripheral blood
   - **Tissue-resident NK cells**: Specialised populations in liver, uterus, and other tissues

3. **Mouse NK Cell Subsets**:
   - Lack CD56 expression
   - Identified by NK1.1 (in some strains), NKp46, and CD49b (DX5)
   - Functionally similar division between cytotoxic and cytokine-producing subsets

**Recognition Strategies: The "Missing-Self" and "Altered-Self" Concepts**
NK cell function is regulated by a sophisticated balance of inhibitory and activating receptors.

1. **Missing-Self Recognition**:
   - Proposed by Kärre in 1986
   - NK cells eliminate targets lacking self-MHC class I molecules
   - **Inhibitory receptors** that recognise MHC class I:
     - **KIRs** (killer immunoglobulin-like receptors): Primarily in humans
     - **Ly49 receptors**: In mice
     - **CD94/NKG2A**: Recognises HLA-E in humans, Qa-1b in mice
   - Viruses and tumours often downregulate MHC I to evade T cells, but this makes them susceptible to NK cells

2. **Altered-Self Recognition**:
   - Stress-induced or pathogen-induced molecules on target cells engage activating NK receptors
   - **Activating receptors**:
     - **NKG2D**: Recognises stress-induced MICA/B and ULBPs in humans, RAE-1 and H60 in mice
     - **Natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs)**: NKp30, NKp44, NKp46
     - **DNAM-1**: Recognises CD155 and CD112
     - **Activating KIRs and Ly49s**: Recognise specific MHC I alleles
   - **CD16 (FcγRIIIA)**: Mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)

3. **Integration of Signals**:
   - NK activation requires overcoming inhibitory signals
   - Depends on cumulative signalling rather than single receptor engagement
   - "Licensing" or "education" process during development sets activation threshold

**Effector Functions**

1. **Cytotoxicity Mechanisms**:
   - **Granule exocytosis pathway**:
     - Polarised release of perforin and granzymes
     - Perforin forms pores in target cell membrane
     - Granzymes enter and induce apoptosis via caspase-dependent and independent mechanisms
   - **Death receptor pathway**:
     - Expression of Fas ligand and TRAIL
     - Engagement of death receptors on target cells
     - Activation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway

2. **Cytokine and Chemokine Production**:
   - **IFN-γ**: Activates macrophages, enhances MHC expression, promotes Th1 differentiation
   - **TNF-α**: Pro-inflammatory effects, direct cytotoxicity
   - **GM-CSF**: Stimulates myeloid cell production and activation
   - **Chemokines**: CCL3, CCL4, CCL5 recruit additional immune cells

3. **Regulatory Functions**:
   - Modulation of dendritic cell maturation and function
   - Cross-talk with T cells to shape adaptive responses
   - Elimination of over-activated immune cells (e.g., activated T cells)

**NK Cell Activation in Various Contexts**

1. **Viral Infections**:
   - Particularly important against herpesviruses (CMV, HSV, EBV)
   - Recognise virus-encoded MHC decoys and viral proteins
   - Human CMV infection leads to expansion of NKG2C+ NK cells (memory-like feature)

2. **Cancer Surveillance**:
   - Recognise stress-induced ligands on transformed cells
   - Eliminate tumour cells with low MHC I expression
   - Coordinate anti-tumour immune responses through DC activation and IFN-γ production

3. **Pregnancy**:
   - Specialised uterine NK cells (uNK) represent 50-90% of lymphocytes in decidua
   - Regulate trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodelling
   - Contribute to immune tolerance of the semi-allogeneic fetus

4. **Bacterial and Parasitic Infections**:
   - Activation by accessory cell-derived cytokines (IL-12, IL-15, IL-18)
   - IFN-γ production enhances macrophage killing of intracellular pathogens

**Clinical Relevance and Therapeutic Applications**

1. **NK Cell Deficiencies**:
   - **Classical NK cell deficiency**: Absent NK cells; recurrent herpesvirus infections
   - **Functional NK cell deficiency**: Normal numbers but impaired function
   - **Chédiak-Higashi syndrome**: Defective granule exocytosis
   - **Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis**: Perforin mutations

2. **NK Cells in Disease Pathogenesis**:
   - **Autoimmunity**: Both protective and pathogenic roles described
   - **Recurrent pregnancy loss**: Abnormal uNK cell function implicated
   - **Viral hepatitis progression**: NK cell dysfunction associated with chronic hepatitis

3. **Immunotherapeutic Approaches**:
   - **Adoptive NK cell transfer**: Allogeneic NK cells for haematological malignancies
   - **CAR-NK cells**: Chimeric antigen receptor-expressing NK cells for targeted therapy
   - **Cytokine therapy**: IL-15 agonists to enhance NK cell function
   - **Blockade of inhibitory receptors**: Anti-KIR antibodies to enhance tumour killing

#### 4.3 Pattern Recognition Receptors and Signalling

Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are germline-encoded sensors that detect conserved molecular signatures associated with pathogens or tissue damage, providing the first step in innate immune activation.

**Overview of Pattern Recognition**
The innate immune system relies on PRRs to identify potential threats and initiate appropriate responses.

2. **Properties of Ideal PAMPs**:
   - Conserved across pathogens but absent from host
   - Essential for microbial fitness (limiting evolutionary escape)
   - Invariant within a class of microorganisms
   - Readily distinguishable from "self" molecules

3. **Classification of PRRs**:

   - **Autoimmunity**: Implicated in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis
   - **Basophilia**: Rare finding, associated with myeloproliferative disorders

**Interplay Between Mast Cells, Eosinophils, and Basophils**
These cells interact in complex networks during allergic and parasitic responses:

1. **Sequential Recruitment and Activation**:
   - Mast cells (tissue-resident) respond first
   - Basophils quickly recruited from circulation
   - Eosinophils arrive later, recruited by chemokines

## Conclusion

In this second part of our course, we have explored the complex world of innate immunity—the body's first line of defence against invading pathogens. We've examined how physical barriers, antimicrobial molecules, complement proteins, and specialised immune cells work together to provide immediate protection while simultaneously initiating and shaping adaptive immune responses.

Key concepts covered include:
- The sophisticated nature of epithelial barriers that provide more than simple physical protection
- The ancient and diverse antimicrobial peptide system that offers broad-spectrum defence
- The complement cascade that bridges innate and adaptive immunity
- The inflammatory response and its systemic counterpart, the acute phase response
- The remarkable diversity of innate immune cells and their specialised functions
- The pattern recognition systems that allow discrimination between self and non-self

In the next part, we will delve into adaptive immunity, beginning with B lymphocytes and humoral immunity. We'll explore how the remarkable specificity and memory of adaptive responses develop from the foundation laid by the innate immune system, and how these two branches of immunity function as an integrated network rather than separate entities.

<Alert type="note">
The innate immune system, once considered a simple, nonspecific first line of defence, is now recognised as a highly sophisticated network with remarkable specificity and regulatory capacity. Recent advances have revealed the complex interplay between innate and adaptive immunity, with innate responses determining the nature and quality of subsequent adaptive responses. Understanding these interactions has led to new therapeutic approaches, including adjuvants that specifically target pattern recognition receptors and biologics that modulate innate immune pathways in inflammatory diseases.
