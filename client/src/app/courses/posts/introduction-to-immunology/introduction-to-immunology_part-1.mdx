## Part I: Fundamentals of Immunology

### 1. Introduction to the Immune System

#### 1.1 Core Functions and Significance

The immune system is responsible for three essential functions that maintain our health and survival:

1. **Definition of Self**: The immune system creates a molecular identity that distinguishes the body's own cells and tissues from foreign entities.

2. **Recognition of Foreign Molecules**: It detects non-self structures and signals that could indicate potential threats.

3. **Defence of the Organism**: It protects against various threats including:
   - **Pathogens**: Bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites
   - **Altered Self-Cells**: Cancer cells with mutations
   - **Foreign Cells**: Transplanted tissues

The immune system's importance cannot be overstated—it functions continuously throughout our lives, often without our awareness. Immunodeficiencies dramatically illustrate this importance; individuals with compromised immunity face life-threatening infections from typically harmless microorganisms. Consider X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), where affected children must live in protective isolation because ordinary environmental microbes pose lethal threats.

Our immune defences must be remarkably sophisticated to differentiate between:
- Harmful pathogens requiring elimination
- Beneficial commensal organisms (e.g., gut microbiota) that aid our health
- The body's own tissues that must be preserved

This balancing act requires precise regulation and multiple checkpoints to prevent inappropriate responses that could cause autoimmunity or chronic inflammation.

#### 1.2 Overview of Innate and Adaptive Immunity

The immune system operates through two complementary branches:

**Innate Immunity**
- **Characteristics**:
  - Immediate action (minutes to hours)
  - Non-specific recognition of conserved microbial patterns
  - No immunological memory
  - Present from birth; evolutionarily ancient
  
- **Components**:
  - **Physical Barriers**: Skin, mucous membranes, tight junctions
  - **Cellular Components**: Neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells
  - **Soluble Factors**: Complement proteins, antimicrobial peptides, cytokines
  - **Physiological Barriers**: pH, temperature, chemical mediators

**Adaptive Immunity**
- **Characteristics**:
  - Delayed response (days to weeks)
  - Highly specific for particular molecular structures (epitopes)
  - Development of immunological memory
  - Improves with each exposure (i.e., adapts)
  
- **Components**:
  - **B Lymphocytes**: Produce antibodies for humoral immunity
  - **T Lymphocytes**: Orchestrate cell-mediated immunity
  - **Antigen-Presenting Cells**: Process and present antigens to lymphocytes
  - **Specialised Tissues**: Thymus, bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen

The innate and adaptive systems don't operate in isolation but form a closely integrated network where each enhances the other's function. Innate responses occur rapidly and control initial infections while simultaneously triggering and directing adaptive responses. In turn, adaptive mechanisms enhance innate functions through antibody opsonisation, complement activation, and cytokine signalling.

#### 1.3 Properties of the Adaptive Immune System

The adaptive immune system exhibits several remarkable properties that differentiate it from innate immunity:

**Specificity**
The adaptive immune system can distinguish between subtly different molecular structures called epitopes. An epitope (antigenic determinant) represents the smallest recognisable pattern within an antigen, typically consisting of 8-15 amino acids or monosaccharide residues that form a three-dimensional structure. 

This specificity arises from the antigen receptors on B and T lymphocytes:
- **B cell receptors (BCRs)** recognise native three-dimensional epitopes
- **T cell receptors (TCRs)** recognise linear peptide fragments presented on MHC molecules

The exquisite specificity of these receptors enables discrimination between:
- Different species of bacteria
- Distinct viral strains
- Self vs. non-self proteins differing by a single amino acid

Furthermore, the response to antigens can be:
- **Polyclonal**: Multiple lymphocytes responding to different epitopes on the same antigen
- **Monoclonal**: A single clone of lymphocytes responding to one specific epitope

**Diversity**
The human immune system can recognise an astounding 10<sup>7</sup>-10<sup>9</sup> different antigens, despite our genome containing only approximately 25,000 genes. This tremendous diversity is achieved through clever genetic mechanisms:

1. **V(D)J Recombination**: During lymphocyte development, gene segments (Variable, Diversity, and Joining) are randomly assembled to create unique antigen receptors. This combinatorial process produces millions of distinct receptor possibilities.

2. **Junctional Diversity**: Imprecise joining of V(D)J segments creates additional variation at junction sites.

3. **Somatic Hypermutation**: In activated B cells, genes encoding the variable regions of antibodies undergo targeted mutations, generating variants with potentially improved antigen binding.

These mechanisms allow lymphocytes to produce approximately 10<sup>11</sup> different antigen receptors from a limited genetic template—a stunning example of biological efficiency.

**Memory**
Unlike innate immunity, the adaptive immune system "remembers" previous encounters with pathogens, enabling:

1. **Faster Responses**: Secondary immune responses initiate within hours rather than days
2. **Stronger Responses**: Higher antibody titres and more effective T cell responses
3. **More Efficient Responses**: Greater antibody affinity and improved pathogen clearance

This memory is embodied in specialised long-lived memory cells:
- **Memory B cells**: Persist for decades and can rapidly differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells upon reexposure
- **Memory T cells**: Include tissue-resident populations that provide frontline defence at common infection sites

Immunological memory forms the biological basis for vaccination, one of medicine's most powerful tools for preventing infectious diseases.

#### 1.4 Determination of Self vs. Non-Self

The immune system's ability to differentiate between "self" and "non-self" molecules represents one of its most sophisticated features.

**Historical Understanding**
Our understanding of self/non-self discrimination was revolutionised by Peter Medawar's transplantation experiments in the 1950s. In these landmark studies, skin grafts between different mouse strains were rejected, but exposure to donor cells during foetal development induced tolerance to subsequent grafts from the same donor strain. This demonstrated that self-tolerance is actively acquired during development rather than being innate.

**Mechanisms of Self-Tolerance**
The immune system employs multiple mechanisms to establish and maintain tolerance to self:

1. **Central Tolerance**:
   - In the thymus, developing T cells undergo positive selection (survival of cells that recognise self-MHC) and negative selection (elimination of cells that strongly bind self-peptide/MHC complexes)
   - In the bone marrow, developing B cells that strongly recognise self-antigens are eliminated or undergo receptor editing

2. **Peripheral Tolerance**:
   - **Anergy**: Self-reactive lymphocytes that escape central tolerance can be rendered functionally unresponsive
   - **Regulatory T cells (Tregs)**: Specialised CD4+ T cells that actively suppress potentially harmful immune responses
   - **Ignorance**: Some self-antigens are physically sequestered from the immune system (e.g., in immune-privileged sites like the brain and testes)

**The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)**
Central to self/non-self discrimination is the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), a cluster of genes encoding cell-surface proteins that:
- Present peptide fragments from both self and foreign proteins
- Are highly polymorphic (many variants exist in the population)
- Determine tissue compatibility for transplantation

In humans, MHC molecules are called Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA), while in mice they're known as H-2 antigens. MHC molecules serve as cellular "ID cards" that identify cells as self or foreign.

**MHC Classes**:
- **Class I** (HLA-A, B, C): Present on virtually all nucleated cells; interact with CD8+ T cells
- **Class II** (HLA-DP, DQ, DR): Present primarily on professional antigen-presenting cells; interact with CD4+ T cells

The MHC's extreme polymorphism ensures population-level diversity in immune recognition, helping species survive emerging pathogen threats. However, this same diversity makes tissue and organ transplantation challenging without immunosuppression.

#### 1.5 Autoregulation of the Immune System

The immune system possesses sophisticated regulatory mechanisms to ensure appropriate responses are generated while preventing excessive inflammation or autoimmunity.

**Key Regulatory Mechanisms**:

1. **Cytokine Networks**:
   Cytokines—small, secreted proteins—form complex communication networks that can either amplify or suppress immune responses:
   - **Pro-inflammatory cytokines**: IL-1, TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ
   - **Anti-inflammatory cytokines**: IL-10, TGF-β, IL-4
   - **Regulatory cytokines**: IL-2 (for Treg maintenance)

2. **Cellular Regulation**:
   - **Regulatory T cells (Tregs)**: Express CD4 and CD25, produce IL-10 and TGF-β
   - **Regulatory B cells (Bregs)**: Produce IL-10 and inhibit T cell activation
   - **Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)**: Inhibit T cell proliferation and function

3. **Receptor-Mediated Regulation**:
   - **Inhibitory receptors**: CTLA-4, PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3
   - **Fc receptors**: Regulate antibody-mediated responses
   - **Complement regulators**: Control complement activation

4. **Negative Feedback Loops**:
   - **Activation-induced cell death (AICD)**: Eliminates overly stimulated lymphocytes
   - **Antigen clearance**: Removes the stimulus driving the immune response
   - **Antibody feedback**: Antibodies can inhibit further antibody production through Fc receptor signalling

**Idiotypic Network Theory**:
Originally proposed by Niels Jerne in 1974, this theory suggests that antibodies generate anti-idiotype antibodies (antibodies against antibodies), creating a self-regulating network. While controversial, certain aspects have been validated, and the principle underlies some autoimmune disease treatments.

**Immune Homeostasis and Dysregulation**:
When regulatory mechanisms fail, serious conditions can develop:
- **Autoimmune diseases**: Result from breakdown of self-tolerance (e.g., multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes)
- **Chronic inflammation**: Persistent immune activation (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease)
- **Immunodeficiency**: Insufficient immune responses (e.g., CVID, SCID)
- **Allergic conditions**: Inappropriate responses to harmless antigens (e.g., asthma, food allergies)

Understanding these regulatory pathways has led to revolutionary therapeutics that modulate immune responses, including:
- Checkpoint inhibitors for cancer (e.g., anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4)
- Cytokine-targeting biologics for autoimmunity (e.g., anti-TNF, anti-IL-6)
- Cell-based therapies (e.g., CAR-T cells, Treg therapy)

The immune system can be conceptualised as an orchestrated symphony of cells and molecules, each with defined roles that must harmonise to maintain health. Disruption of this balance—whether through genetic factors, environmental triggers, or ageing—can lead to disease states requiring therapeutic intervention.

### 2. Anatomy of the Immune System

#### 2.1 Primary and Secondary Lymphoid Organs

The immune system is anatomically organised into distinct tissues and organs that support the development, maturation, and function of immune cells.

**Primary (Central) Lymphoid Organs**
Primary lymphoid organs are the sites where lymphocytes develop and mature from precursor cells. These organs provide the specialised microenvironments necessary for lymphocyte education and selection.

1. **Bone Marrow**
   - Origin of all haematopoietic cells through haematopoiesis
   - Site of B cell development and maturation in mammals
   - Contains specialised niches that support stem cell maintenance
   - Consists of red marrow (haematopoietically active) and yellow marrow (fat storage)
   
   In adults, red marrow is primarily found in the sternum, vertebrae, ribs, hip bones, and proximal ends of long bones. The bone marrow microenvironment includes:
   - Stromal cells that provide critical growth factors
   - Sinusoidal vasculature for cell trafficking
   - Mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblasts that form niches

2. **Thymus**
   - Primary site of T cell development and maturation
   - Located in the upper anterior thorax, above the heart
   - Reaches maximum size during puberty, then gradually involutes with age
   
   The thymus has a distinctive lobular structure with:
   - An outer cortex containing immature thymocytes undergoing selection
   - An inner medulla where mature T cells accumulate before release
   - Specialised thymic epithelial cells that express self-antigens (including AIRE-dependent tissue-specific antigens)
   - Hassall's corpuscles in the medulla, important for regulatory T cell development

3. **Bursa of Fabricius** (in birds only)
   - Lymphoid organ unique to birds, located near the cloaca
   - Site of B cell development in avian species
   - Historically significant as the organ that gave B cells their name

**Secondary (Peripheral) Lymphoid Organs**
Secondary lymphoid organs provide environments where mature lymphocytes can encounter antigens and initiate immune responses. These organs are strategically positioned to intercept pathogens entering through various routes.

1. **Lymph Nodes**
   - Small, bean-shaped organs distributed throughout the body
   - Filter lymphatic fluid before it returns to the blood circulation
   - Organised into distinct regions:
     - B cell follicles (with germinal centres after activation)
     - T cell zones (paracortex)
     - Medullary sinuses containing macrophages
   
   Lymph nodes contain:
   - Afferent lymphatic vessels that bring in lymph fluid
   - High endothelial venules (HEVs) where lymphocytes enter from the blood
   - Follicular dendritic cells that present antigen to B cells
   - A single efferent lymphatic vessel that carries lymph out

2. **Spleen**
   - Largest secondary lymphoid organ
   - Located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen
   - Filters blood rather than lymph
   - Contains two main compartments:
     - Red pulp: Removes ageing erythrocytes and blood-borne pathogens
     - White pulp: Lymphoid tissue organised around central arterioles
   
   The spleen's white pulp includes:
   - Periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths (PALS) rich in T cells
   - B cell follicles
   - Marginal zone containing specialised macrophages and B cells
   
   The spleen is critical for defence against encapsulated bacteria, which explains why splenectomised patients require vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria meningitidis.

3. **Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT)**
   - Diffuse collections of lymphoid tissue associated with mucosal surfaces
   - Comprises approximately 70% of the body's immune cells
   - Includes several specialised compartments:
     - Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT): Peyer's patches, isolated lymphoid follicles
     - Nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT): Waldeyer's ring (tonsils, adenoids)
     - Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT)
     - Conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT)
   
   MALT features include:
   - M cells that transport antigens across epithelial barriers
   - Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs)
   - Plasma cells secreting IgA antibodies
   - Specialised dendritic cell subsets

#### 2.2 The Lymphatic System and Circulation

The lymphatic system forms a parallel circulatory network crucial for immune function, interstitial fluid balance, and lipid absorption.

**Structure and Components**
The lymphatic system consists of:

1. **Lymphatic Vessels**
   - **Lymphatic capillaries**: Blind-ended vessels with specialised junctions that allow interstitial fluid entry
   - **Collecting vessels**: Contain valves to prevent backflow and smooth muscle for lymph propulsion
   - **Lymphatic trunks**: Larger vessels that ultimately form the thoracic duct and right lymphatic duct
   
2. **Lymphoid Tissues**
   - Primary and secondary lymphoid organs
   - Tertiary lymphoid structures that form at sites of chronic inflammation
   
3. **Lymph**
   - Clear fluid containing:
     - Lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells
     - Protein-rich interstitial fluid
     - Antigens and microbial products from tissues
     - Lipids absorbed from the intestine (chylomicrons)

**Lymphocyte Circulation Patterns**
Lymphocytes continuously recirculate between blood, lymphoid tissues, and the lymphatics:

1. **Entry into Lymph Nodes**
   - From blood: Via high endothelial venules (HEVs) through interaction between lymphocyte adhesion molecules (e.g., L-selectin, LFA-1) and endothelial ligands (e.g., addressins, ICAM-1)
   - From tissues: Via afferent lymphatics draining the periphery
   
2. **Surveillance within Lymphoid Tissues**
   - T cells migrate through T cell zones, sampling dendritic cells for cognate antigen
   - B cells traverse follicles, interacting with follicular dendritic cells
   - In the absence of activation, lymphocytes exit via efferent lymphatics
   
3. **Return to Circulation**
   - Efferent lymphatics → larger lymphatic vessels → thoracic duct → left subclavian vein → blood circulation

This recirculation allows the relatively small population of lymphocytes specific for any given antigen to survey the entire body efficiently.

**Specialised Circulation Patterns**
Different lymphocyte subsets follow distinct migration patterns based on their expression of homing receptors:

- **Naive T and B cells**: Circulate primarily between blood and secondary lymphoid organs
- **Effector T cells**: Migrate to inflamed tissues guided by inflammatory chemokines
- **Memory T cells**:
  - Central memory (T<sub>CM</sub>): Recirculate through lymphoid tissues
  - Effector memory (T<sub>EM</sub>): Patrol peripheral tissues
  - Tissue-resident memory (T<sub>RM</sub>): Permanently reside in tissues without recirculating
- **Mucosal-homing lymphocytes**: Express α4β7 integrin and CCR9, targeting them to intestinal tissues

**Clinical Relevance**
Dysfunction of the lymphatic system can lead to:
- **Lymphoedema**: Accumulation of interstitial fluid due to lymphatic vessel obstruction
- **Impaired immune surveillance**: Increased susceptibility to infection and cancer
- **Compromised immune responses**: Delayed adaptive immunity if antigen transport to lymph nodes is disrupted

Understanding lymphocyte trafficking patterns has led to therapeutic strategies targeting these mechanisms, including:
- **FTY720 (fingolimod)** for multiple sclerosis: Prevents lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes
- **Natalizumab**: Blocks α4 integrin to prevent lymphocyte migration into the CNS and gut
- **Vedolizumab**: Selectively blocks α4β7 integrin to inhibit gut-specific homing

#### 2.3 Cellular Components of the Immune System

The immune system comprises a diverse array of cell types, each with specialised functions that contribute to host defence.

**Haematopoietic Origins**
All immune cells originate from haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow, which differentiate along distinct lineages:

1. **Lymphoid Lineage**
   - B lymphocytes
   - T lymphocytes
   - Natural killer (NK) cells
   - Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)

     - Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells

3. **Natural Killer (NK) Cells**
   - Large granular lymphocytes that comprise about 5-15% of peripheral blood lymphocytes
   - Recognise stressed, infected, or malignant cells through a balance of activating and inhibitory receptors
   - Mediate cytotoxicity and cytokine production
   - Serve as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity

**Phagocytes**
Phagocytic cells engulf and destroy microorganisms and cellular debris:

1. **Neutrophils**
   - Most abundant leukocyte in peripheral blood (50-70%)
   - First cells recruited to sites of infection (within hours)
   - Short-lived (circulation half-life of 6-8 hours)
   - Contain granules with antimicrobial peptides and enzymes
   - Can form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to trap pathogens

2. **Monocytes/Macrophages**
   - Monocytes circulate in blood (5-10% of leukocytes) before migrating into tissues
   - Differentiate into tissue-specific macrophages (e.g., Kupffer cells in liver, microglia in CNS)
   - Long-lived cells with diverse functions:
     - Phagocytosis of pathogens and cellular debris
     - Antigen presentation
     - Cytokine production
     - Tissue repair and remodelling
   - Exhibit remarkable plasticity, ranging from pro-inflammatory (M1) to tissue-reparative (M2) phenotypes

3. **Dendritic Cells (DCs)**
   - Professional antigen-presenting cells that bridge innate and adaptive immunity
   - Capture antigens in tissues and migrate to lymph nodes to activate T cells
   - Major subsets include:
     - Conventional DCs (cDC1, cDC2)
     - Plasmacytoid DCs (specialised in antiviral responses via type I interferons)
     - Langerhans cells (found in epidermis)
     - Follicular dendritic cells (not derived from haematopoietic stem cells)

**Granulocytes**
Named for their prominent cytoplasmic granules containing effector molecules:

1. **Neutrophils** (described above)

2. **Eosinophils**
   - Comprise 1-3% of peripheral blood leukocytes
   - Important in defence against helminths and parasites
   - Involved in allergic reactions
   - Contain basic proteins toxic to parasites and tissue cells

3. **Basophils**
   - Least common leukocyte in peripheral blood (< 1%)
   - Similar to tissue mast cells in function
   - Release histamine and other mediators during allergic responses
   - Express high-affinity IgE receptors (FcεRI)

**Other Immune Cells**

1. **Mast Cells**
   - Tissue-resident cells abundant near epithelial surfaces
   - Critical in allergic reactions and parasite expulsion
   - Release preformed mediators (histamine, proteases) and synthesise lipid mediators

2. **Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILCs)**
   - Lymphocyte-like cells lacking antigen-specific receptors
   - Mirror T helper cell subsets in cytokine production
   - Important in mucosal immunity and tissue homeostasis

#### 2.4 Molecular Components of the Immune System

Beyond cellular elements, the immune system relies on a sophisticated array of molecular components that mediate recognition, signalling, and effector functions.

**Antibodies/Immunoglobulins**
Antibodies are glycoproteins produced by B cells that specifically recognise and bind antigens.

1. **Structure**
   - Y-shaped molecules composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains
   - Each chain contains variable regions (antigen-binding sites) and constant regions
   - Disulphide bonds maintain the quaternary structure
   - The Fab region contains antigen-binding sites
   - The Fc region mediates effector functions

2. **Classes (Isotypes)**
   - **IgG**: Major antibody in serum; crosses placenta; four subclasses (IgG1-4)
   - **IgM**: First antibody produced during primary response; pentameric in serum
   - **IgA**: Predominant antibody at mucosal surfaces; dimeric with secretory component
   - **IgE**: Involved in parasitic infections and allergic responses; binds to mast cells

   - **Transforming Growth Factors (TGF)**: Often immunoregulatory

2. **Properties**
   - Pleiotropic: One cytokine affects multiple cell types
   - Redundant: Multiple cytokines may have similar effects
   - Synergistic or antagonistic: Cytokines modulate each other's effects
   - Act locally (autocrine, paracrine) or systemically (endocrine)

3. **Examples and Functions**
   - **IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α**: Pro-inflammatory; induce acute phase response

   - **IL-22**: Epithelial repair and antimicrobial peptide production

**Complement System**
The complement system comprises over 30 proteins that function in a cascading manner to eliminate pathogens.

1. **Activation Pathways**
   - **Classical**: Initiated by antibody-antigen complexes
   - **Alternative**: Spontaneously activated on microbial surfaces
   - **Lectin**: Triggered by mannose-binding lectin on microbial carbohydrates

2. **Major Components**

**Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs)**
PRRs detect conserved microbial structures and alert the innate immune system.

1. **Toll-like Receptors (TLRs)**
   - **Cell surface TLRs** (TLR1, 2, 4, 5, 6): Recognise bacterial and fungal components
   - **Endosomal TLRs** (TLR3, 7, 8, 9): Detect nucleic acids

2. **NOD-like Receptors (NLRs)**
   - Cytoplasmic sensors for microbial products and danger signals
   - Some form inflammasomes, activating caspase-1 and IL-1β/IL-18 processing

3. **RIG-I-like Receptors (RLRs)**
   - Detect viral RNA in the cytoplasm
   - Initiate antiviral responses via type I interferons

4. **C-type Lectin Receptors (CLRs)**
   - Recognise carbohydrate structures on pathogens
   - Examples: Dectin-1, mannose receptor, DC-SIGN

#### 2.5 Development and Maturation of Immune Cells

The development of a functional immune system requires precise regulation of cellular differentiation, selection, and maturation processes.

**Haematopoiesis: The Foundation of Immune Cell Development**
All immune cells originate from haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow, which undergo progressive differentiation:

1. **HSC Niches and Maintenance**
   - HSCs reside in specialised microenvironments within bone marrow
   - Key niche components include:
     - Osteoblasts and osteoclasts
     - Endothelial cells
     - Mesenchymal stromal cells
     - CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells
   - Maintenance depends on:
     - Cell-intrinsic factors (transcription factors like RUNX1, SCL/TAL1)
     - Extrinsic signals (stem cell factor, thrombopoietin, Wnt, Notch)

2. **Lineage Commitment**
   - HSCs differentiate into multipotent progenitors (MPPs)
   - MPPs give rise to common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs)
   - Transcription factor networks drive lineage specification:
     - PU.1 and C/EBPα for myeloid development
     - E2A, EBF, and Pax5 for B cell development
     - Notch signalling and GATA3 for T cell development

**B Cell Development**
B cells develop in the bone marrow through a series of well-defined stages:

1. **Early Development (Antigen-Independent)**
   - Pro-B cells: Begin immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement
   - Pre-B cells: Express pre-BCR (μ heavy chain + surrogate light chain)
   - Immature B cells: Express complete IgM (μ heavy chain + κ or λ light chain)

2. **Central Tolerance Mechanisms**
   - Clonal deletion: Strongly self-reactive B cells undergo apoptosis
   - Receptor editing: Some autoreactive B cells rearrange new light chains
   - Anergy: Partial inactivation of self-reactive B cells

3. **Peripheral Maturation**
   - Transitional B cells migrate to secondary lymphoid organs
   - Further selection and maturation into:
     - Follicular B cells (conventional B-2 cells)
     - Marginal zone B cells
     - B-1 cells (develop mostly during foetal and neonatal life)

**T Cell Development**
T cells develop in the thymus through a complex process involving migration through distinct microenvironments:

1. **Early Development**
   - Thymic settling progenitors enter the thymus at the cortico-medullary junction
   - Progression through double-negative stages (DN1-DN4), defined by CD44 and CD25 expression
   - TCR β chain rearrangement and pre-TCR formation

2. **Selection Processes**
   - **Positive selection** in the cortex:
     - CD4+CD8+ (double-positive) thymocytes test TCR interaction with self-MHC
     - Those that recognise self-MHC receive survival signals
     - Lineage commitment to either CD4+ or CD8+ single-positive T cells
   
   - **Negative selection** primarily in the medulla:
     - Elimination of thymocytes with high affinity for self-peptide/MHC
     - AIRE protein in medullary thymic epithelial cells enables expression of tissue-specific antigens
     - Regulatory T cell development as an alternative fate for some self-reactive cells

3. **Thymic Emigration and Peripheral Maturation**
   - Mature single-positive T cells exit the thymus via blood vessels
   - Recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) undergo further maturation in periphery
   - Naive T cells circulate through blood and lymphatics, seeking cognate antigen

**Myeloid Cell Development**

1. **Granulocyte Development**
   - Granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) give rise to neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils
   - Terminal differentiation involves:
     - Progressive nuclear segmentation
     - Granule formation with stage-specific content
     - Expression of lineage-specific receptors

2. **Monocyte/Macrophage Development**
   - Monocytes develop from GMPs in bone marrow
   - Enter circulation and migrate to tissues, where they can differentiate into:
     - Tissue-resident macrophages with specific phenotypes
     - Dendritic cells under certain conditions
   - Some tissue-resident macrophages derive from embryonic precursors and self-maintain

3. **Dendritic Cell Development**
   - cDC1s and cDC2s develop from common DC progenitors (CDPs)
   - Plasmacytoid DCs also derive from CDPs
   - Langerhans cells develop from embryonic precursors and can self-renew

**Developmental Disorders and Clinical Significance**
Defects in immune cell development can lead to severe clinical disorders:

1. **Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)**
   - Multiple genetic causes affecting lymphocyte development
   - X-linked SCID: Mutations in IL-2Rγ, affecting multiple cytokine receptors
   - ADA deficiency: Toxic metabolites accumulate, poisoning lymphocyte development

2. **X-linked Agammaglobulinaemia (XLA)**
   - Mutations in Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK)
   - B cell development arrests at pre-B stage
   - Patients lack mature B cells and antibodies

3. **DiGeorge Syndrome**
   - Thymic hypoplasia due to 22q11.2 deletion
   - Impaired T cell development
   - Variable severity of immunodeficiency

Understanding immune cell development has led to:
- Advanced diagnostics for immunodeficiencies
- Therapeutic approaches to reconstitute immune function
- Insights into cancer biology, particularly leukaemias and lymphomas
- Strategies for immune system regeneration after chemotherapy or transplantation

## Conclusion

In this first part of our course, we have explored the fundamental principles and structural organisation of the immune system. We've examined how this remarkable defence network maintains a delicate balance between responding to threats while preserving self-tolerance—a balance that, when disrupted, can lead to immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, or chronic inflammation.

Key concepts covered include:
- The distinct yet complementary roles of innate and adaptive immunity
- The remarkable properties of adaptive immunity—specificity, diversity, and memory
- The sophisticated mechanisms of self/non-self discrimination
- The anatomical organisation of the immune system from molecular to organ level
- The developmental pathways that generate specialised immune cells

In the next part, we will delve deeper into innate immunity, exploring the first lines of defence that not only provide immediate protection but also set the stage for adaptive responses. We'll examine how evolutionary ancient pattern recognition systems allow rapid detection of microbial threats and how these systems have been conserved across species while acquiring additional sophistication in vertebrates.

<Alert type="note">
The immune system represents one of the most complex and fascinating systems in human biology, with implications for virtually every aspect of health and disease. Recent advances in immunology have revolutionised our understanding of diseases ranging from infections to cancer, autoimmunity, and even neurodegenerative conditions. These insights have led to breakthrough therapeutic approaches including checkpoint inhibitors for cancer, cytokine-targeting biologics for autoimmune diseases, and emerging cellular therapies.
