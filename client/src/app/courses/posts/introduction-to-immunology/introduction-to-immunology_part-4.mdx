## Part IV: Adaptive Immunity: T Lymphocytes and Cell-Mediated Immunity

### 7. T Cell Development and Activation

#### 7.1 T Cell Development in the Thymus

T lymphocytes, central orchestrators of cell-mediated immunity, develop through a sophisticated process that occurs primarily in the thymus. This developmental journey involves complex interactions with thymic stromal cells, sequential differentiation events, and stringent selection processes that collectively shape a functional, self-tolerant T cell repertoire.

**Thymic Microenvironment**

The thymus provides a specialised microenvironment essential for T cell development:

1. **Anatomical Organisation**
   - Bilobed organ located in the anterior mediastinum above the heart
   - Each lobe is organised into an outer cortex and inner medulla
   - Cortex: Site of early T cell development and positive selection
   - Medulla: Site of late development and negative selection

2. **Cellular Components**
   - **Thymic epithelial cells (TECs)**:
     - Cortical TECs (cTECs): Support early development and positive selection
     - Medullary TECs (mTECs): Express AIRE and tissue-specific antigens for negative selection
   - **Dendritic cells**: Present self-antigens for negative selection
   - **Macrophages**: Clear apoptotic thymocytes
   - **Fibroblasts**: Provide structural support and growth factors

3. **Molecular Factors**
   - **Notch signalling**: Critical for T lineage commitment
   - **IL-7**: Supports survival and proliferation
   - **Chemokines**: Guide migration through thymic compartments
   - **Stem cell factor (SCF)**: Supports early progenitor maintenance

**Stages of T Cell Development**

T cell development proceeds through distinct stages marked by changes in surface markers and developmental events:

1. **Early Thymic Progenitors (ETPs)**
   - Migrate from bone marrow to the thymus via blood vessels at the cortico-medullary junction
   - Characterised as CD4-CD8- (double-negative, DN) cells
   - Express high levels of c-Kit (CD117) and CD44

2. **Double-Negative (DN) Stages**
   - **DN1 (CD44+CD25-)**: Uncommitted progenitors; retain potential for NK and DC development
   - **DN2 (CD44+CD25+)**: Commit to T lineage; begin TCR gene rearrangement
   - **DN3 (CD44-CD25+)**: Complete TCRβ gene rearrangement; express pre-TCR
   - **DN4 (CD44-CD25-)**: Proliferate following pre-TCR signalling; prepare for CD4/CD8 expression

3. **Double-Positive (DP) Stage**
   - Express both CD4 and CD8 coreceptors (CD4+CD8+)
   - Rearrange TCRα gene to complete αβ TCR formation
   - Undergo positive selection based on TCR recognition of self-peptide/MHC complexes
   - Approximately 90% of DP thymocytes fail positive selection and die by "death by neglect"

4. **Single-Positive (SP) Stage**
   - Differentiate into either CD4+CD8- or CD4-CD8+ T cells based on MHC restriction
   - Undergo negative selection to eliminate strongly self-reactive cells
   - Mature in the medulla before exiting to the periphery
   - Some self-reactive cells may be diverted to regulatory T cell lineage

**Selection Processes**

The thymus imposes two critical selection processes to generate a functional, self-tolerant T cell repertoire:

1. **Positive Selection**
   - Occurs in the thymic cortex, mediated by cTECs
   - Tests the ability of TCRs to recognise self-MHC molecules
   - Thymocytes with TCRs that cannot interact with self-MHC undergo apoptosis ("death by neglect")
   - Surviving cells are "MHC-restricted" – CD4+ T cells restricted to MHC II, CD8+ T cells to MHC I

2. **Negative Selection**
   - Occurs primarily in the thymic medulla
   - Eliminates thymocytes with high affinity for self-peptide/MHC complexes
   - Mediated by mTECs (express AIRE for promiscuous gene expression) and dendritic cells
   - Creates "central tolerance" by removing potentially autoreactive T cells
   - Approximately 5% of positively selected thymocytes are eliminated during negative selection

3. **Lineage Commitment**
   - Based on TCR-MHC interactions and signalling strength
   - Cells recognising MHC II become CD4+ T cells (helper lineage)
   - Cells recognising MHC I become CD8+ T cells (cytotoxic lineage)
   - Some cells with intermediate affinity for self-antigens develop into regulatory T cells

**TCRαβ vs. TCRγδ Development**

While the majority of thymocytes develop into αβ T cells, a subset develops into γδ T cells:

1. **Divergence Point**
   - Branching occurs primarily at the DN2/DN3 stage
   - Determined by TCR gene rearrangement, Notch signalling strength, and cytokine influences

2. **γδ T Cell Development**
   - Express TCRγ and TCRδ chains instead of α and β
   - Do not generally require positive and negative selection
   - Most do not express CD4 or CD8 coreceptors
   - Exit the thymus as functional cells with innate-like properties
   - Important in mucosal immunity and surveillance of stressed/transformed cells

**Thymic Output and Involution**

The thymus exhibits age-dependent changes that affect T cell development:

1. **Thymic Output**
   - Highest during childhood and adolescence
   - Produces approximately 10^7-10^8 T cells daily in young individuals
   - Recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) identified by expression of CD31 and TCR excision circles (TRECs)

2. **Thymic Involution**
   - Progressive age-related decrease in size and function beginning at puberty
   - Results in reduced naive T cell output
   - Associated with increased adipose tissue infiltration and decreased thymic epithelial compartment
   - May contribute to age-related immune dysfunction and reduced response to novel antigens

**Clinical Implications**

Disruptions in T cell development can lead to various clinical disorders:

1. **DiGeorge Syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome)**
   - Thymic hypoplasia or aplasia due to developmental defects
   - Severely reduced T cell numbers and function
   - Increased susceptibility to infections and autoimmunity

2. **Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)**
   - Multiple genetic causes affecting T cell development (e.g., IL-7R, RAG1/2, CD45, ADA deficiencies)
   - Profound T cell deficiency, often with associated B and NK cell defects
   - Life-threatening infections without treatment (bone marrow transplant or gene therapy)

3. **Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 1**
   - Mutations in AIRE gene impair negative selection
   - Development of autoimmunity against multiple organs, particularly endocrine glands
   - Illustrates the critical role of thymic selection in preventing autoimmunity

#### 7.2 TCR Structure and Signalling

The T cell receptor (TCR) is a sophisticated molecular sensor that enables T cells to recognise specific peptide-MHC complexes. Understanding TCR structure and signalling provides insight into how T cells initiate adaptive immune responses.

**TCR Structure**

The TCR is a heterodimeric protein comprised of two transmembrane chains that form the antigen recognition unit:

1. **TCR Chains**
   - **αβ TCR**: Expressed by ~95% of peripheral T cells
     - α chain: 40-60 kDa glycoprotein
     - β chain: 40-50 kDa glycoprotein
   - **γδ TCR**: Expressed by ~5% of peripheral T cells
     - γ chain: 45-60 kDa glycoprotein
     - δ chain: 40-60 kDa glycoprotein

2. **Structural Domains**
   - **Variable (V) regions**: Form the antigen-binding site
     - Contain complementarity-determining regions (CDRs)
     - CDR3 is most variable and makes primary contact with the peptide
     - CDR1 and CDR2 primarily contact the MHC
   - **Constant (C) regions**: Proximal to the membrane
   - **Transmembrane regions**: Contain positively charged residues
   - **Short cytoplasmic tails**: Minimal signalling capacity

3. **TCR Complex**
   The TCR heterodimer associates with the CD3 complex and ζ chains to form the complete TCR complex:
   - **CD3 complex**: Composed of CD3γ, CD3δ, and CD3ε chains
   - **ζ chains**: Form a homodimer (ζ-ζ)
   - These accessory proteins contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) for signal transduction

**TCR Gene Rearrangement**

Similar to immunoglobulin genes, TCR genes undergo somatic recombination to generate diversity:

1. **Gene Loci**
   - **TCRα**: Located on chromosome 14 in humans
     - Vα segments (40-45)
     - Jα segments (50-60)
     - Cα segment (1)
   - **TCRβ**: Located on chromosome 7 in humans
     - Vβ segments (40-48)
     - Dβ segments (2)
     - Jβ segments (12-13)
     - Cβ segments (2)
   - **TCRγ and TCRδ**: Similar organisation but fewer segments

2. **Recombination Process**
   - Mediated by recombination-activating genes (RAG1 and RAG2)
   - β chain: D-J joining, followed by V-DJ joining
   - α chain: Direct V-J joining
   - Junctional diversity through P- and N-nucleotide additions
   - Estimated potential diversity: 10^15-10^18 different TCRs
   - Actual peripheral repertoire: 10^7-10^8 unique TCRs in humans

3. **Allelic Exclusion**
   - Less stringent than in B cells
   - Approximately 30% of T cells express two α chains
   - β chain exhibits strict allelic exclusion

**TCR Signalling Pathway**

TCR engagement initiates a complex signalling cascade that leads to T cell activation:

1. **Initial Signalling Events**
   - Binding of TCR to peptide-MHC complex
   - Recruitment of coreceptors (CD4 or CD8)
   - Activation of Lck (associated with coreceptors)
   - Phosphorylation of ITAMs in CD3 and ζ chains
   - Recruitment and activation of ZAP-70 kinase

2. **Signalling Cascade**
   - Phosphorylation of adaptor proteins (LAT, SLP-76)
   - Activation of PLCγ1
   - Generation of second messengers:
     - Diacylglycerol (DAG): Activates PKC and RAS-MAPK pathway
     - Inositol trisphosphate (IP3): Triggers calcium release
   - Calcium-dependent activation of calcineurin
   - Nuclear translocation of transcription factors:
     - NF-κB
     - NFAT
     - AP-1

3. **Transcriptional Reprogramming**
   - Induction of early activation genes
   - Production of IL-2 and IL-2 receptor
   - Expression of activation markers (CD69, CD25, CD71)
   - Metabolic reprogramming with shift to glycolysis
   - Cell cycle entry and proliferation

**Regulation of TCR Signalling**

Multiple mechanisms regulate TCR signalling to ensure appropriate responses:

1. **Phosphatases**
   - CD45: Activates Lck by removing inhibitory phosphorylation
   - SHP-1 and SHP-2: Negatively regulate signalling
   - PTPN22: Inhibits TCR signalling by dephosphorylating substrates

2. **Inhibitory Receptors**
   - CTLA-4: Competes with CD28 for B7 ligands; recruits phosphatases
   - PD-1: Recruits SHP-2 to inhibit TCR signalling
   - LAG-3, TIM-3, TIGIT: Additional negative regulators

3. **Ubiquitination and Degradation**
   - Cbl-b: E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets TCR signalling components
   - ITCH: Regulates TCR signalling through ubiquitination of various substrates

4. **Spatial Organisation**
   - Lipid rafts: Concentrate or exclude signalling components
   - Immunological synapse formation: Organises receptors and signalling molecules
   - Endocytosis of TCR: Attenuates signalling

**TCR Signalling Strength and Outcomes**

The strength and duration of TCR signalling influence T cell fate and function:

1. **Signal Strength Effects**
   - Very weak signals: Ignorance or anergy
   - Weak signals: Survival signals for naive T cells
   - Moderate signals: Activation and differentiation
   - Strong signals: Activation-induced cell death

2. **Signalling in Different T Cell Subsets**
   - Naive T cells: Require stronger signals for activation
   - Memory T cells: Lower activation threshold
   - Regulatory T cells: TCR signalling maintains suppressive function
   - γδ T cells: Often ligand-independent or non-peptide-MHC restricted signalling

#### 7.3 Coreceptors and Costimulatory Molecules

The "two-signal model" of T cell activation states that TCR engagement alone is insufficient for full T cell activation. A second signal, provided by costimulatory molecules, is essential to induce proper activation rather than anergy or apoptosis.

**Coreceptors: CD4 and CD8**

Coreceptors enhance TCR signalling by stabilising TCR-MHC interactions and recruiting signalling molecules:

1. **CD4**
   - Expressed on helper T cells
   - Binds to invariant regions of MHC class II molecules
   - Contains four immunoglobulin-like domains (D1-D4)
   - Associates with Lck via its cytoplasmic tail
   - Increases T cell sensitivity to antigen by 10-100 fold

2. **CD8**
   - Expressed on cytotoxic T cells
   - Binds to invariant regions of MHC class I molecules
   - Exists as αα homodimer or αβ heterodimer
   - Associates with Lck via cytoplasmic tail
   - Enhances sensitivity to antigen by stabilising TCR-peptide-MHC interactions

**Major Costimulatory Pathways**

1. **CD28-B7 Pathway**
   - **CD28**: Constitutively expressed on naive T cells
   - **Ligands**: B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) on APCs

   - **Functions**:
     - Promotes T cell survival and expansion
     - Enhances cytokine production
     - Important for memory T cell generation
     - Inhibits regulatory T cell function

5. **4-1BB-4-1BBL Pathway**
   - **4-1BB (CD137)**: Expressed on activated T cells

   - **Functions**:
     - Particularly important for CD8+ T cell responses
     - Enhances proliferation and survival
     - Increases cytolytic function
     - Promotes memory formation

**Inhibitory Receptors and Ligands**

These molecules counterbalance costimulatory signals and are crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis:

1. **CTLA-4-B7 Pathway**
   - **CTLA-4**: Induced after T cell activation; constitutive on Tregs
   - **Ligands**: Same as CD28 (CD80, CD86) but higher affinity
   - **Functions**:
     - Outcompetes CD28 for B7 binding
     - Recruits phosphatases to inhibit TCR signalling
     - Mediates transendocytosis of B7 molecules
     - Critical for peripheral tolerance

2. **PD-1-PD-L1/PD-L2 Pathway**

2. **Diagnostic Value**
   - Expression patterns of costimulatory and inhibitory molecules help identify T cell functional states
   - Important for monitoring immune responses during infection, cancer, and autoimmunity

#### 7.4 MHC Restriction and Antigen Recognition

A fundamental feature of T cell immunity is MHC restriction – the requirement for T cells to recognise antigens only when presented by self-MHC molecules. This principle, elucidated by Zinkernagel and Doherty (earning them the 1996 Nobel Prize), is central to T cell development and function.

**Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Molecules**

MHC molecules are cell surface glycoproteins encoded within the MHC gene cluster (known as HLA in humans):

1. **MHC Class I**
   - **Structure**: Heavy chain (α) with three domains (α1, α2, α3) associated with β2-microglobulin
   - **Genes**: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C in humans
   - **Expression**: Almost all nucleated cells
   - **Peptide Binding**:
     - Closed-ended peptide binding groove
     - Binds peptides of 8-10 amino acids
     - Anchor residues at positions 2 and 9
   - **Function**: Presents intracellular antigens to CD8+ T cells

2. **MHC Class II**
   - **Structure**: Two chains (α and β) each with two domains (α1, α2, β1, β2)
   - **Genes**: HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR in humans
   - **Expression**: Professional APCs (dendritic cells, B cells, macrophages)
   - **Peptide Binding**:
     - Open-ended peptide binding groove
     - Binds peptides of 13-25 amino acids
     - Multiple anchor positions
   - **Function**: Presents extracellular antigens to CD4+ T cells

3. **MHC Polymorphism**
   - Most polymorphic genes in the human genome
   - Thousands of allelic variants identified
   - Polymorphisms concentrated in the peptide-binding regions
   - Provides population-level protection against pathogens
   - Complicates tissue transplantation

**TCR-Peptide-MHC Interactions**

The molecular details of T cell recognition involve specific contacts between the TCR and peptide-MHC complex:

1. **Binding Orientation**
   - TCR binds diagonally across the peptide-MHC surface
   - CDR3 loops primarily contact the peptide
   - CDR1 and CDR2 loops primarily contact the MHC

2. **Binding Energetics**
   - Low affinity interaction (K<sub>D</sub> ≈ 1-100 μM)
   - Slow association rate
   - Relatively fast dissociation rate
   - Coreceptors stabilise the interaction

3. **Peptide Contacts**
   - TCR typically contacts 3-5 solvent-exposed residues of the peptide
   - Single amino acid changes can abolish recognition
   - Explains exquisite specificity of T cell responses

4. **MHC Contacts**
   - Germline-encoded regions of TCR interact with conserved MHC features
   - Provides basis for MHC restriction
   - Supported by evolutionary co-development of TCR and MHC

**Mechanisms of MHC Restriction**

Several models explain how T cells become MHC-restricted:

1. **Thymic Selection Model**
   - Positive selection preserves T cells that recognise self-MHC
   - Negative selection eliminates cells with high affinity for self-peptide/MHC
   - This model is strongly supported by experimental evidence

2. **Germline Model**
   - TCRs have evolved inherent bias for MHC recognition
   - CDR1 and CDR2 regions have conserved interactions with MHC
   - Supported by structural studies showing similar docking modes across TCRs

3. **Coreceptor Model**
   - CD4 and CD8 reinforce MHC restriction by binding only to appropriate MHC classes
   - Coreceptors help position Lck for signalling
   - Experimental removal of coreceptors can sometimes permit non-MHC restricted recognition

**Cross-Reactivity and Molecular Mimicry**

Despite MHC restriction, T cells exhibit some flexibility in recognition:

1. **T Cell Cross-Reactivity**
   - A single TCR can recognise multiple different peptide-MHC complexes
   - Estimated that one TCR may recognise 10<sup>6</sup> different peptides
   - Important for broad immune coverage with limited TCR repertoire

2. **Molecular Mimicry**
   - Pathogen-derived peptides may resemble self-peptides
   - Can lead to cross-reactive responses and autoimmunity
   - Implicated in several autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatic fever, Guillain-Barré syndrome)

3. **Altered Peptide Ligands (APLs)**
   - Peptide variants that bind the same MHC but elicit different T cell responses
   - Can act as partial agonists, antagonists, or superagonists
   - Important concept for understanding T cell activation thresholds

**Non-Classical MHC and Non-MHC Restricted Recognition**

Not all T cell recognition follows conventional rules:

1. **Non-Classical MHC Molecules**
   - **MHC class Ib** (HLA-E, HLA-F, HLA-G in humans)
   - **CD1 family**: Presents lipid antigens
   - **MR1**: Presents microbial metabolites to MAIT cells

2. **Non-MHC Restricted Recognition**
   - γδ T cells often recognise antigens without MHC presentation
   - Some recognise stress-induced molecules like MICA/MICB
   - Others recognise phosphoantigens directly

3. **Superantigens**
   - Bacterial or viral proteins that bridge TCR and MHC outside the peptide-binding groove
   - Bind to Vβ regions of many different TCRs
   - Activate up to 20% of all T cells regardless of peptide specificity
   - Can cause toxic shock syndrome and food poisoning

### 8. T Cell Subsets and Functions

#### 8.1 CD4+ T Helper Cells

CD4+ T helper cells orchestrate adaptive immune responses by secreting cytokines that influence the function of other immune cells. These cells differentiate into distinct subsets with specialised roles based on the cytokine environment during activation.

#### 8.2 CD8+ Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes

CD8+ T cells, also known as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), are specialised for eliminating virus-infected cells, intracellular bacteria-infected cells, and cancer cells. They recognise peptides presented by MHC class I molecules and deploy a diverse arsenal of cytotoxic mechanisms.

**Development and Activation**

CD8+ T cells follow distinct developmental and activation pathways:

1. **CD8+ T Cell Development**
   - Positive selection on MHC class I in the thymus
   - Require less costimulation than CD4+ T cells for activation
   - Can be activated by dendritic cells, sometimes without CD4+ T cell help

2. **Primary Activation Requirements**
   - Recognition of peptide-MHC class I complexes
   - Costimulatory signals (CD28:B7, 4-1BB:4-1BBL)
   - Inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, type I IFNs)
   - CD4+ T cell help (particularly for memory generation)

3. **Activation Outcomes**
   - Rapid proliferation (8-10 divisions within days)
   - Acquisition of cytotoxic function
   - Production of effector cytokines
   - Migration to infection sites

**Cytotoxic Mechanisms**

CD8+ T cells eliminate target cells through several mechanisms:

1. **Granule Exocytosis Pathway**
   - **Perforin**: Creates pores in target cell membrane
   - **Granzymes**: Serine proteases that enter through perforin pores
     - Granzyme B: Activates caspases directly and indirectly
     - Granzyme A: Induces single-stranded DNA damage
   - **Granulysin**: Antimicrobial protein that damages bacterial membranes

2. **Death Receptor Pathway**
   - Expression of FasL (CD95L)
   - Engagement of Fas (CD95) on target cells
   - Activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway
   - Important for eliminating activated lymphocytes (immune homeostasis)

3. **Cytokine-Mediated Killing**
   - Production of IFN-γ and TNF-α
   - IFN-γ: Enhances MHC expression, activates macrophages, has direct antiviral effects
   - TNF-α: Can induce apoptosis through TNFR1 signalling

**Immunological Synapse Formation**

CTL killing is a precise process involving the formation of a specialised contact site:

1. **Synapse Assembly**
   - Initial scanning and recognition of peptide-MHC
   - Adhesion molecule engagement (LFA-1:ICAM-1)
   - Cytoskeletal reorganisation with actin polymerisation
   - Polarisation of secretory machinery

2. **Molecular Organisation**
   - Central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC): TCR, CD8, signalling molecules
   - Peripheral SMAC (pSMAC): Adhesion molecules
   - Secretory domain: Site of granule release

3. **Target Cell Killing**
   - Directional release of cytotoxic granules
   - Maintenance of contact until target death
   - Detachment and engagement of new targets
   - Single CTL can kill multiple targets sequentially

**Memory CD8+ T Cells**

Following pathogen clearance, a subset of CD8+ T cells persists as memory cells:

1. **Memory Subset Development**
   - **Short-lived effector cells (SLECs)**: KLRG1<sup>high</sup> IL-7R<sup>low</sup>; die after pathogen clearance
   - **Memory precursor effector cells (MPECs)**: KLRG1<sup>low</sup> IL-7R<sup>high</sup>; survive to form memory

2. **Memory Subsets**
   - **Central memory (T<sub>CM</sub>)**: CD62L<sup>high</sup> CCR7<sup>high</sup>; circulate through lymphoid tissues; high proliferative capacity
   - **Effector memory (T<sub>EM</sub>)**: CD62L<sup>low</sup> CCR7<sup>low</sup>; patrol non-lymphoid tissues; rapid effector function
   - **Resident memory (T<sub>RM</sub>)**: CD69<sup>+</sup> CD103<sup>+/-</sup>; permanently reside in tissues; provide frontline defense

3. **Key Features**
   - Rapid recall response without costimulation requirement
   - Maintained by IL-7 and IL-15
   - Exhibit distinct metabolic features (reliance on fatty acid oxidation)
   - Subject to attrition upon subsequent infections

**CD8+ T Cells in Disease**

CD8+ T cells play central roles in numerous disease states:

1. **Protective Functions**
   - Clearance of viral infections (influenza, CMV, HIV)
   - Control of intracellular bacterial infections
   - Surveillance and elimination of cancer cells
   - Long-term immunity after vaccination

2. **Pathological Roles**

   - Immune checkpoint blockade to enhance anti-tumour responses
   - Vaccination strategies targeting CD8+ T cell responses

#### 8.3 Regulatory T Cells and Immune Tolerance

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are specialised subsets of T lymphocytes that suppress immune responses and maintain immune homeostasis. They are crucial for preventing autoimmunity, limiting inflammatory responses, and establishing tolerance to self and harmless environmental antigens.

**Treg Subtypes and Development**

Several populations of Tregs exist, differentiated by their developmental origin and phenotypic characteristics:

1. **Thymic Tregs (tTregs)**
   - Develop in the thymus during T cell development
   - Generated when thymocytes encounter self-antigens with intermediate affinity
   - Express high levels of CD25, CTLA-4, and Foxp3
   - Primarily mediate tolerance to self-antigens

2. **Peripheral Tregs (pTregs)**
   - Develop in peripheral tissues from conventional CD4+ T cells
   - Generated under tolerogenic conditions (TGF-β, retinoic acid, IL-2)
   - Important for tolerance to food antigens, commensal microbiota, and fetal antigens during pregnancy

3. **Tr1 Cells**
   - Characterised by high IL-10 production
   - Do not stably express Foxp3
   - Express the surface markers LAG-3 and CD49b
   - Primarily induced at mucosal surfaces

4. **Foxp3+ Treg Phenotypic Markers**
   - CD25 (IL-2 receptor α chain): high expression
   - CTLA-4 (CD152): constitutive expression
   - GITR (glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein)
   - CD39/CD73 (ectonucleotidases)
   - Neuropilin-1 (distinguishes tTregs from pTregs in mice)
   - Low expression of CD127 (IL-7 receptor α chain)

**Molecular Control of Treg Development and Stability**

The development and functional stability of Tregs involves complex molecular mechanisms:

1. **Foxp3: The Master Regulator**
   - Transcription factor essential for Treg development and function
   - Regulates expression of over 700 genes
   - Mutations cause IPEX syndrome (Immune dysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-linked)
   - Expression stabilised by epigenetic modifications, particularly demethylation of Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR)

2. **Signalling Pathways in Treg Development**
   - TCR signalling with intermediate strength
   - IL-2 signalling through STAT5
   - TGF-β signalling through Smad proteins
   - Notch signalling influences Foxp3 expression

3. **Transcriptional Networks**
   - **Positive regulators**: NFAT, AP-1, Runx1, STAT5, Smad3
   - **Negative regulators**: RORγt, GATA3, T-bet (context-dependent)
   - **Epigenetic regulators**: DNMT1, Tet proteins, EZH2

4. **Metabolic Requirements**
   - Rely more on oxidative phosphorylation than glycolysis
   - Sensitive to environmental metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids)
   - mTOR inhibition promotes Treg development

**Suppressive Mechanisms**

Tregs employ multiple mechanisms to suppress immune responses:

1. **Contact-Dependent Mechanisms**
   - **CTLA-4**: Removes CD80/CD86 from APCs through transendocytosis
   - **LAG-3**: Binds MHC-II with high affinity and delivers inhibitory signals
   - **Neuropilin-1**: Extends Treg-DC interactions
   - **Granzyme/perforin**: Direct killing of effector T cells (more common in CD8+ Tregs)

2. **Inhibitory Cytokines**
   - **IL-10**: Suppresses APC function and effector T cell responses
   - **TGF-β**: Inhibits T cell proliferation and promotes iTreg generation
   - **IL-35**: Heterodimeric cytokine that suppresses T cell proliferation

3. **Metabolic Disruption**
   - High CD25 expression allows IL-2 consumption, depriving effector T cells
   - CD39/CD73 convert ATP to adenosine, which has immunosuppressive effects
   - Competition for essential amino acids (e.g., through indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase induction)

4. **Modulation of Dendritic Cells**
   - Induction of tolerogenic DCs that express IDO
   - Inhibition of DC maturation and costimulatory molecule expression
   - Reduction of proinflammatory cytokine production by DCs

**Tissue-Specific and Functional Adaptations**

Tregs exhibit remarkable adaptability to different tissue environments and inflammatory contexts:

1. **Tissue-Resident Tregs**

   - **Th1-like Tregs**: T-bet+ Tregs that suppress Th1 responses
   - **Th2-like Tregs**: GATA3+ Tregs that control Th2 inflammation
   - **Th17-like Tregs**: RORγt+ Tregs that regulate mucosal immunity

3. **Adaptation to Inflammation**
   - Responsiveness to tissue-specific inflammatory signals
   - Expression of chemokine receptors matching effector T cells
   - Metabolic adaptation to inflammatory microenvironments
   - Enhanced suppressive mechanisms during active inflammation

**Tregs in Health and Disease**

Dysregulation of Treg function contributes to various diseases:

1. **Autoimmunity**
   - **IPEX syndrome**: Due to Foxp3 mutations; severe multi-organ autoimmunity
   - **Type 1 diabetes**: Imbalance between effector T cells and Tregs
