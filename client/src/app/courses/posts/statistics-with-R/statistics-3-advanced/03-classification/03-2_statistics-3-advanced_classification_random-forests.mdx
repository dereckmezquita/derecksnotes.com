# Part 2: Random Forests

A single decision tree is interpretable but unstable—small changes in data can produce dramatically different trees. **Random forests** overcome this limitation by growing hundreds of trees on bootstrapped samples, then averaging their predictions. This "wisdom of crowds" approach dramatically reduces variance while maintaining the flexibility of trees. Random forests have become the workhorse of practical machine learning, consistently delivering strong performance across domains.
