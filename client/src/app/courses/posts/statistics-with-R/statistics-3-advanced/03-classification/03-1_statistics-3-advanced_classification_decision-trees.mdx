# Part 1: Decision Trees

**Decision trees** are among the most interpretable machine learning methods. They partition the feature space through a sequence of binary splits, creating a flowchart-like structure that clinicians can readily understand and apply. A physician can trace through a decision tree to see exactly why the model predicts a patient is at high risk—no black box involved. This transparency makes trees invaluable in medical contexts where explainability is paramount.
