## 15.16 The Replication Crisis

### 15.16.1 What Happened?

In recent years, science has faced a crisis: many published findings fail to replicate when independent researchers attempt to reproduce them.

## 15.17 P-Hacking and Researcher Degrees of Freedom

### 15.17.1 What Is P-Hacking?

**P-hacking** (also called "data dredging" or "fishing") refers to manipulating data or analyses until a significant result is obtained.


``` r
# Simulate p-hacking
set.seed(123)
n <- 50

# Generate data with NO true effect
x <- rnorm(n)
y <- rnorm(n)
extra1 <- rnorm(n)
extra2 <- rnorm(n)

# Honest analysis
honest_result <- cor.test(x, y)

# P-hacking: try different analyses
phack_results <- list(
    "Raw correlation" = cor.test(x, y)$p.value,
    "Remove outliers" = cor.test(x[abs(scale(x)) < 2], y[abs(scale(x)) < 2])$p.value,
    "Log transform x" = cor.test(log(x - min(x) + 1), y)$p.value,
    "Control for extra1" = summary(lm(y ~ x + extra1))$coefficients[2, 4],
    "Use extra1 as DV" = cor.test(x, extra1)$p.value,
    "Subset: x > median" = cor.test(x[x > median(x)], y[x > median(x)])$p.value,
    "Subset: extra2 > 0" = cor.test(x[extra2 > 0], y[extra2 > 0])$p.value
)

### 15.17.2 The Garden of Forking Paths

Every analysis involves many choices. Each choice creates a "fork" in the path:


``` r
choices <- data.table(
    Stage = c("Data Collection", "Data Collection", "Data Collection",
              "Preprocessing", "Preprocessing", "Preprocessing",

    Choice = c(
        "When to stop collecting",
        "Which participants to exclude",
        "Which variables to measure",
        "How to handle missing data",
        "Outlier treatment",
        "Transformation of variables",
        "Which covariates to include",
        "Which test to use",
        "One-tailed vs two-tailed"
    ),
    Options = c("2-5", "2-3", "5-10", "3-4", "2-3", "2-4", "2-10", "2-3", "2")
)

## 15.21 Effect Size Focus

### 15.21.1 Beyond Significance

Instead of obsessing over p < 0.05, focus on:
1. **Effect size**: How big is the effect?
2. **Confidence interval**: What is the range of plausible values?
3. **Practical significance**: Does it matter in the real world?

## Quick Reference

### Reproducibility Best Practices

| Practice | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Pre-registration | Prevent HARKing and p-hacking |
| Power analysis | Ensure adequate sample size |
| Report all outcomes | Prevent selective reporting |
| Share data/code | Enable verification |
| Effect sizes + CIs | Go beyond significance |
| Distinguish confirmatory/exploratory | Maintain proper error rates |

### Warning Signs

| Sign | Possible Issue |
|------|----------------|
| p = 0.049 | Possible p-hacking |
| Huge effect, small n | Winner's curse |
| Many tests, no correction | Inflated false positive rate |
| Results differ from protocol | Outcome switching |
