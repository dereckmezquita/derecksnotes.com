## Preface

This first volume in the Statistics with R series establishes the foundational concepts that underpin all statistical analysis. We begin with the fundamental question: What is statistics? From there, we explore data types, collection methods, and the art of describing data numerically and graphically.

By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of:

- The distinction between populations and samples
- Types of variables and measurement scales
- Sampling methods and their implications
- Measures of central tendency, dispersion, and shape
- How to detect and handle outliers
- Working with grouped data

This foundation prepares you for the subsequent courses on probability theory, statistical inference, and advanced methods.

Throughout this course, we use biomedical and clinical examples to ground abstract concepts in real-world applications. You will work with publicly available datasets from sources such as NHANES, the medicaldata R package, NHLBI teaching datasets, and simulated clinical trial data.

## Pedagogical Approach

Every concept in this course is presented using a **four-part teaching method**:

### 1. Prose and Intuition

First, we explain the concept in plain language with analogies, examples, and context. We answer: What is this? Why does it matter? When would you use it? We build intuition before introducing any formalism.

### 2. Visualisation

Second, we demonstrate the concept visually. Graphs, diagrams, and simulations help you *see* what's happening. Visualisation bridges the gap between intuition and mathematics.

### 3. Mathematical Derivation

Third, we present the formal mathematics. We don't simply state formulae — we _derive_ them. We show how the formula was discovered, why it takes the form it does, and what each component means. You will understand not just *what* to compute, but *why* the computation works.

### 4. Communicating To Stakeholders

At the end of important sections we include a review of what we learned and how to communicate it to stakeholders. Communication is an essential part of every statistician's job and is often overlooked in traditional statistics education.

## Prerequisites

This course assumes familiarity with basic R programming and comfort with mathematical notation. Each chapter concludes with a **Quick Reference** section summarising key formulae and code, allowing the course to serve as a reference manual.
