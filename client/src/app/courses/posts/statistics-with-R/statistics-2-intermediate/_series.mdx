## Preface

This second volume in the Statistics with R series builds upon the foundational concepts from Part I to explore the rich landscape of statistical modelling. We move from simple linear relationships to the sophisticated toolkit of generalised linear models, mixed-effects structures, and specialised methods for time-to-event and longitudinal data.

By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of:

- Multiple linear regression and model diagnostics
- The generalised linear model framework (exponential family, link functions)
- Logistic regression for binary outcomes
- Count data models (Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated)
- Mixed-effects models for hierarchical and longitudinal data
- Time series decomposition and ARIMA modelling
- Bayesian inference and MCMC methods
- Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression)
- Multivariate methods (PCA, clustering, discriminant analysis)

This intermediate course prepares you for the advanced topics in Part III: statistical learning, causal inference, and computational statistics.

## Datasets

Throughout this course, we continue using biomedical datasets to ground abstract concepts in clinical applications. Key datasets include:

**Count Data:**
- NMES 1988 physician visits data (doctor office visits count)
- Arizona hospital length of stay (DRG-based hospital data)
- Medicare length of stay and clinical trial adverse events

**Longitudinal Data:**
- AIDS CD4 count longitudinal study (repeated measures)
- Prothrombin ratio in liver disease (biomarker trajectories)
- Multi-site clinical trial data (hierarchical structure)

**Time Series:**
- Disease surveillance data (Salmonella, Influenza, Hepatitis)
- Hospital admissions with seasonal patterns

**Survival Data:**
- PBC (Primary Biliary Cholangitis) sequential data
- Lung cancer survival from NCCTG
- Veteran's Administration lung cancer trial

All datasets are documented in DATA.md and available in the shared `data/` directory.

## Pedagogical Approach

Every concept in this course follows the same **four-part teaching method** established in Part I:

### 1. Prose and Intuition

First, we explain the concept in plain language with analogies, examples, and context. We answer: What is this? Why does it matter? When would you use it? We build intuition before introducing any formalism.

### 2. Visualisation

Second, we demonstrate the concept visually. Graphs, diagrams, and simulations help you *see* what's happening. Visualisation bridges the gap between intuition and mathematics.

### 3. Mathematical Derivation

Third, we present the formal mathematics. We don't simply state formulae — we _derive_ them. We show how the formula was discovered, why it takes the form it does, and what each component means. You will understand not just *what* to compute, but *why* the computation works.

### 4. Communicating to Stakeholders

At the end of important sections we include a review of what we learned and how to communicate it to stakeholders. Communication is an essential part of every statistician's job and is often overlooked in traditional statistics education.

## Prerequisites

This course assumes completion of Part I (Foundations) or equivalent knowledge of:

- Descriptive and inferential statistics
- Probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson)
- Simple linear regression
- Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals
- Basic R programming including data.table and ggplot2

Each chapter concludes with a **Quick Reference** section summarising key formulae and code, allowing the course to serve as a reference manual.
