# Preface

This book serves as the definitive compendium for statistical methods implemented in R. Unlike traditional statistics textbooks that merely present theory or elementary R tutorials that scratch the surface of statistical applications, "Statistics with R" assumes proficiency in R programming and focuses exclusively on robust statistical methodology through a computational lens.

Our aim is to bridge the gap between theoretical statistics and practical implementation, providing a resource that working statisticians, data scientists, researchers, and quantitative analysts can reference daily. Every concept is demonstrated through R code using modern packages like data.table for efficient data manipulation and ggplot2 for publication-quality visualisations. The examples draw from contemporary domains—bioinformatics, finance, environmental science, and social network analysis—reflecting the multidisciplinary nature of modern statistical practice.

This is not merely a book to be read sequentially; it is designed as a comprehensive reference that can be consulted at any stage of statistical analysis. Whether you need to refresh your understanding of mixture models, implement a novel time series approach, or select the appropriate test for complex experimental designs, you will find rigorous explanations accompanied by efficient, production-ready R code.

The statistical landscape continues to evolve rapidly, and this book embraces both classical foundations and cutting-edge methodologies. Our focus remains steadfastly on statistical thinking—understanding when and why particular methods are appropriate—while providing the computational tools to implement these methods with confidence and precision.

## How to Use This Book

This book is structured to serve multiple purposes:

* **As a reference manual**: The detailed table of contents and index allow you to quickly locate specific statistical techniques and their implementations.
* **As a learning resource**: Each chapter builds upon fundamental concepts and progresses to advanced applications.
* **As a source of code examples**: Every statistical method is accompanied by working R code that you can adapt to your own datasets.
* **As a guide to statistical decision-making**: We emphasise not just how to implement methods, but when and why they are appropriate.

The chapters are organised thematically, beginning with foundational concepts and progressing through increasingly sophisticated statistical methodologies. Throughout, we maintain a consistent focus on:

* Statistical reasoning and proper interpretation of results
* Efficient computational implementation using data.table and other high-performance tools
* Practical applications with real-world datasets
* Modern best practices for reproducible research

## Target Audience

This book is written for:

* Statisticians seeking efficient implementations of both standard and advanced methods
* Data scientists with strong R skills looking to deepen their statistical knowledge
* Researchers who need to apply appropriate statistical methodology to their domain-specific problems
* Analysts in quantitative fields who require comprehensive statistical tools for data-driven decision making
* Graduate students in statistics, data science, and quantitative disciplines

While we assume proficiency with R programming, we do not assume prior expertise in statistics. Each concept is explained from first principles, but with a focus on practical implementation rather than mathematical derivation.

## A Note on Approach

In an era where data analysis often emphasises black-box machine learning tools, we deliberately focus on statistical understanding. The methods in this book are not merely techniques to be applied; they are frameworks for thinking about data and uncertainty. Throughout, we emphasise:

* The conceptual foundations underlying each method
* Diagnostics to assess model assumptions and performance
* Interpretation of results in context
* Limitations and potential pitfalls

Our code examples prioritise clarity and efficiency, making heavy use of data.table for data manipulation and ggplot2 for visualisation. We avoid unnecessary abstraction and focus on code that is both instructive and practical for production environments.

We hope that "Statistics with R" becomes your trusted companion in navigating the complex landscape of statistical analysis, providing both the theoretical insights and practical tools needed for rigorous data-driven work.
