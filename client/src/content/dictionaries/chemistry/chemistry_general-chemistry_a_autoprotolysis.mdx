<a id="autoprotolysis">Autoprotolysis</a> - A chemical reaction occuring in water between water molecules themselves H2O in which a proton is transfered between two identical molecules, one playing the role of an acid and the other the base (in the Br√∏nsted context).

 The chemical reaction is written:

 $$ 2H_2 O \rightleftharpoons H_3 O^+ + HO^- $$

 Any solvent which contains acidic hydrogen and lone pairs of electrons with which to accept H+ can demonstrate autoprotolysis, for example ammonia:

 $$ 2NH_3 \rightleftharpoons NH^-_2 + NH^+_4 $$
