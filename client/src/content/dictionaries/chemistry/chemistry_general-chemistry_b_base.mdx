<a id="base">Base</a> - As per the Br√∏nsted definition it is any substance capable of taking a proton, or [Hydrogen](#Hydrogen) particle. As per the Lewis definition a base is any substance capable of releasing a pair of electrons.

Notice that these two definitions are complementary, in that if a base takes on a proton, it is accepting a charged particle H+ from the environment; yet at the same time it must release its electrons 2e\- and share them with the proton in order to form a bond.

A base is written as B\- and its conjugated acid as BH. The couple is written as: B\-/BH.

They are linked together by the two half reactions:

$$
    AH \rightleftharpoons A^- + H^+
$$

$$
    B^- + H^+ \rightleftharpoons BH
$$

Thus the two half reactions together form the complete reaction:

$$
    AH + B^- \rightleftharpoons A^- + BH
$$

Notice that the base is accepting an H from the acid, and in turn the A receives the negative charge \- which in fact represents the two electrons given up by the Hydrogen.

If one were to follow the electrons they go from hydrogen to the A, then from B to the H in order to form the bond.
