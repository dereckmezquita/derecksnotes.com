<a id="π_bond_pi_bond">π bond (Pi bond)</a> - These are covalent chemical bonds where two lobes of an orbital on one atom overlap with two other lobes of another laterally. The Greek letter π is used to refer to the p-orbitals. The symmettry of the π bond is the same as that of the p-orbital; π bonds occur with p-orbitals and or d-orbitals.

π bonds are weaker than σ bonds, requiring 612 kj of energy to break vs 348 kj respectively, that is 264 kj required to break a π bond; as the σ bond is comprised in the 612 kj initially quoted \*(C-C bonds).

Single covalent bonds result in σ bonds, multiple bonds yeild π bonds. These also result in unsaturated molecules, as electrons are used for multiple bond formation rather than fixing H. Note that π bonds do not allow free rotation around the central axis as σ bonds do.
