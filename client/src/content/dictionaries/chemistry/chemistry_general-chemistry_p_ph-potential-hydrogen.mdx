<a id="ph_potential_hydrogen">pH (Potential Hydrogen)</a> - Loosely speaking a measure of the concentration of free protons in an aqueous solution. A more precise definition is the activity of protons in the solution or a measure of \[H3O+\]. This allows us to determine the [acidity](#acid) or [basicity](#base) of a solution. These measurements are all put in the context of water, and relative to water; thus water's pH is equal to 7; acids are less than 7, bases are greater than 7.

 In a base: $$ [HO^-] > H_3 O^+ $$ In an acid: $$ [HO^-] < H_3 O^+ $$
- Hydroxide ions = \[OH\-\]
- Hydronium ions = \[H3O+\]

 pH is measured on a logarithmic scale, it is measured in units of moles per liter of hydrogen ions often called [hydronium ions](#hydronium_ion) sometimes less precisely called [oxonium ions](#oxonium_ion).

 Precisely speaking this measurement of hydrogen ions in a solution can be done experimentally. In fact an experimental measure is designated as p\[H\]. Moreover, the difference between pH and p\[H\] is so small that they are sometimes used interchangeably. The way to find this would be by use of the Nernst equation as shown below:

 $$ E = E^{0} + f\frac{2.303RT}{F}\log\left[ H^{+} \right] $$

 The strict definition of pH does not have associated units, and is dimensionless. It is described as the log of the inverse of hydrogen activity in a solution:

 $$ pH = -log(a_{H^+}) = log\left(\frac{1}{a_{H^+}}\right) $$

 But most often used in the following form with \[H3O+\] being the concentration of hydronium ions in mol/L:

 $$ pH = -log[H_3 O^+] $$ $$ [H_3 O^+] = 10^{-pH} $$
