<a id="aromaticity_aryl">Aromaticity (aryl)</a> - This is the property of being cyclic (a closed ring), and planar with a ring of resonance bonds. Aromatic chemical groups are called aryl. Requirements for aromaticity, known as Huckel's rule, are as follows:

1. The molecule must be cyclic; can be composed of one or more rings.
2. The molecule must be planar, allows for p-orbitals to be parallel and interact.
3. That the molecule must be formed of a continous ring of conjugated π bonds (p-orbital interaction); if a heteronome participates in conjugation then its doublet must be able to be conjugated with the other π bonds.
4. The molecule must have 4n + 2 electrons in a conjugated system (n ∈ ℕ); normally on sp2\-hybridised atoms, and sometimes sp-hybridised.

To apply the rule, count the number of π eletrons in the molecule, then set the equation equal to this number. Solve for n. If n ∈ ℕ, and the other rules are true then the molecule is indeed aromatic.

<Alert type="note">
    Example: benzene, 3 double bonds, 6 π electrons.

    $$
        4n + 2 = 6
    $$
    $$
        4n = 4
    $$
    $$
        n = 1
    $$
    $$
        n \in \mathbb{N}
    $$

    In order to know which are the π electrons to be counted, you must look at those which reside in the p-orbitals; the hybrid atoms have one p-orbital each. Thus if each part of the cyclic compound is hybridised sp2 then this means that the molecule is completely conjugated (each atom has one p-orbital) and the electrons in these p orbitals are in fact π electrons.

Aromatic molcules are very stable and do not react easily with other compounds. Most common aromatic compounds are derivatives of benzene (found in petroleum).

Aromaticity does not necessarily indicate an odour. This misnomer comes from the association initially given by August Wilhelm Hofmann in 1855 who studied a class of benzene molecules; which did indeed emit odours.

Chemically aromaticity refers to a conjugated system made of alternating single and double bonds in a ring. This arrangement allows for electrons in the molecule's π system to be delocalised; increasing the molecules stability. Such molecules are represented by a resonance hybrid of different strucutres.

Bond lengths in such a strucutre are the intermediate of the two composing representations. X-ray diffraction has shown that all six carbon-carbon bonds in benzene are of the same length: 1.4 Å. C-C double bonds are typically at 1.35 Å, and single bonds at 1.47 Å.

    The π orbitals allow for the double bond stick out of the ring, this allows for the double bond formation; consequently these orbitals can then share any electrons involved.

The ring contains π bonds which are formed from the overlap of atomic p-orbitals; which can interact with each other freely as they are outside the plane of the molecule. Each electron is shared by all six atoms in the ring; there are not enough electrons to form double bonds between all carbon atoms, but the "extra" electrons strengthen the exisiting bonds and give rise to the resonance structure.
