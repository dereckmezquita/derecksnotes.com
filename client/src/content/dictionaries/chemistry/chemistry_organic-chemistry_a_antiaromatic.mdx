<a id="antiaromatic">Antiaromatic</a> - If a molecule has 4n π electrons and has the all other characteristics for aromaticity then it is said to be antiaromatic.

1. The molecule must be cyclic.
2. The molecule must be planar, allows for p-orbitals to be parallel and interact.
3. That the molecule must be formed of a continous ring of conjugated π bonds (p-orbital interaction); if a heteronome participates in conjugation then its doublet must be able to be conjugated with the other π bonds (can be composed of one or more rings).

 Example: cyclobutadiene; the number of π delocalised electrons is 4, its ionic form cyclobutadiene(2\-) is aromatic (6 e\-).
