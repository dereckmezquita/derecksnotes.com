<a id="acid">Acid</a> - An acid as per the Br√∏nsted definition is any substance capable of giving off a proton, or [Hydrogen](#Hydrogen) particle. As per the Lewis definition an acid is any substance capable of accepting a pair of electrons.

 Notice that these two definitions are complementary, in that if: an acid gives off a proton, it is releasing a charged particle H+ into the environment; yet at the same time it must accept those electrons 2e\- from the proton in order to release it.

 An acid is written as AH and its conjugated base as A\-. The couple is written as: AH/A\-.

 They are linked together by the two half reactions:

 $$ AH \rightleftharpoons A^- + H^+ $$ $$ B^- + H^+ \rightleftharpoons BH $$

 Thus the two half reactions together form the complete reaction:

 $$ AH + B^- \rightleftharpoons A^- + BH $$

 Notice that the acid is giving up its H to the base, and in exchange the A receives the negative charge \- which in fact represents the two electrons given up by the Hydrogen.

 If one were to follow the electrons they go from: H to A, and from the B to the H in order to form the bond.
