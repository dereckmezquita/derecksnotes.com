<a id="poh_potential_hydroxide">pOH (Potential Hydroxide)</a> - The inverse of pH, this measures the potential hydroxide activity of a solution: HO\-.

$$
    pOH = -log[OH^-]
$$
    
$$
    [OH^-] = 10^{-pOH}
$$

Note that the sum of pOH along with [pH](#ph_potential_hydrogen) is equal to the total of the scale.

$$
    pH + pOH = 14
$$
