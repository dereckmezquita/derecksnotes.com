<a id="dissociation_constant_water">Dissociation Constant (water)</a> - The rate at which water dissociates from its protons. This can be derived from [autoprotolysis](#autoprotolysis).

 Dissociation constant: $$ K_w = 1.0 \cdot 10^{-14} $$ 

 $$ K_w = \frac{[H_{3}0^{+}][HO^-]}{[ H_{2}0]^2} $$

 Since this is theoretically measured in a pure solution of water and the concentration of pure substances is not taken into account then the formula simplifies to:

 $$ K_w = [H_{3}0^{+}][HO^-] $$

 Moreover, since according to the balanced equation for [autoprotolysis](#autoprotolysis) \[H3O+\] = \[HO\-\], and thus we can simplify the formula even more:

 $$ K_w = X^2 $$

 Thus:

 $$ [H_{3}0^{+}] = [HO^-] = \sqrt{1.0 \cdot 10^{-14}} = 1.0 \cdot 10^{-7} mol/L $$

 And thus we've demonstrated that water's $$ pH = -log(1.0 \cdot 10^{-7}) = 7 $$.
