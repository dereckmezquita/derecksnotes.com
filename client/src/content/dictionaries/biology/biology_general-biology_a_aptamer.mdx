<a id="aptamer">Aptamer</a> - A sequence of [RNA](#rna) (or sometimes [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid)) that folds into a particular 3D structure, enabling it to bind some [ligand molecule](#ligand), *exempli gratia* caffeine, with high [specificity](#specificity) and strength. Binding of the [ligand](#ligand) can sometimes induce a [conformational change](#conformation) in the aptamer, which can be used as a signal for the binding event in the case of aptamer-based circuits.
