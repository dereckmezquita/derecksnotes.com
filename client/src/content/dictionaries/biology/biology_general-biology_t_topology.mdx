<a id="topology">Topology</a> - In the context of regulatory networks, the topology refers to the way the [nodes](#node) (*exempli gratia* [genes](#gene)) are connected (which kinds of arrows go from which [nodes](#node) to which [nodes](#node)). An abstract gene-regulatory network has some topology that could be implemented by many ways by choosing the suitable components for each node.
