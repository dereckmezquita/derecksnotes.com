<a id="anneal">Anneal</a> - In the context of [DNA assembly](#dna_assembly) this means the coming together of [complementary](#complementary) (or [near-complementary](#complementary), in some cases) sequences of [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid). This is often assisted by a change in temperature: two [complementary sequences](#complementary) are often heated up (to say 95Â°C) and then allowed to cool down. The heating removes self-annealing, which causes [secondary structures](#secondary_structure) to form in the [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid), which might [inhibit](#inhibitor) annealing to the other [molecule](#molecule). The cooling down allows the formation of [hydrogen bonds](#hydrogenBond) between the two [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) strands. The opposite process to annealing is melting or [denaturing](#denature) of [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid), which happens at high temperatures.
