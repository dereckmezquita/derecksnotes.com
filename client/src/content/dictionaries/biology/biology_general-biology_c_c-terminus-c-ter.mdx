<a id="c_terminus_c_ter">C Terminus (C-ter)</a> - Also called the carboxyl-terminus or the COOH-terminus, this refers to the end of an [amino acid](#amino_acid) chain which holds the chemical group of COOH. Note this is the end of the chain which is generated last; the [N terminus](#nTerminus) is the first to come out of the [ribosome](#ribosome) during [translation](#translation).
