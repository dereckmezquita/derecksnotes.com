<a id="tale_taler_talen">TALE, TALER, TALEN</a> - [Transcription](#transcription) activator-like effectors (**TALEs**) are [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) binding [proteins](#protein) that have a "code" relating just two specific [amino acids](#amino_acid) in their [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid)\-binding regions to a [nucleotide](#nucleotide) in the [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) that is recognised. This "code" has been used by researchers to create a variety of **TALE** [proteins](#protein) that bind specific [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) operator sites.

**TALE** operator sites can be placed near [transcriptional](#transcription) start sites to block [RNA polymerase](#rna_polymerase_rna_p) binding and thus repress [gene expression](#geneExpression). **TALEs** used for this purpose are called **TALE** repressors, or **TALERs**. **TALEs** can also be modified to have [nuclease activity](#nuclease), and cut [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) at specific locations in the genome. These are refered to **TALE** nucleases, or **TALENs**.
