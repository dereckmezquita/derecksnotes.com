<a id="alpha_helix">Alpha Helix</a> - An alpha helix is an [amino acid](#amino_acid) sequence pattern that results in a [secondary structure](#secondary_structure) in the form of a right handed helix. This helix is created by the donation of a hydrogen bond from the backbone N-H groups to the C=O groups. These interactions happen on average every three to four [amino acids](#amino_acid) in a sequence, with about 13 atoms involved in one ring. See also [Î²-sheet](#betaSheet).
