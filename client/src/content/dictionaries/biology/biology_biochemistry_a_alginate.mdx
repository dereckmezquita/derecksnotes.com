<a id="alginate">Alginate</a> - Component of the [cell walls](#cell_wall) of many rhodophytes and kelps. Alginates have an affinity for water, and so help to slow dessication when the algae are exposed to the air; they are commercially important in the production of paper, toothpaste, beer, and frozen foods.
