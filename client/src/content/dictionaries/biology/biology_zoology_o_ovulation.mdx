<a id="ovulation">Ovulation</a> - The process by which an egg (the female gamete) is released from the ovary. In animals other than mammals, with the exception of monotremes, this results in the laying of an egg outside of the body. When female mammals ovulate, the egg, if fertilized, is retained within the uterus.
