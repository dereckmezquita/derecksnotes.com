<a id="processitivity">Processitivity</a> - An [enzyme](#enzyme) is processive if it acts on a [polymeric substrate](#polymer) and [catalyses](#catalysation) a reaction on several of the monomeric [subunits](#Subunit) after binding the [polymer](#polymer). For example, [DNA polymerase](#dna_polymerase) is a processive enzyme, as it binds the [primer-template](#primer) complex and then proceeds to create a new strand of [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) by moving along the template. Higher processivity means that the [enzyme](#enzyme) stays and acts on the [polymer](#polymer) for longer. *Exempli gratia* a [DNA polymerase](#dna_polymerase) can process thousands of [nucleotides](#nucleotide) after a single binding event. Other processive [enzymes](#enzyme) include some [exonucleases](#exonuclease) which constantly chew up the [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid), base by base and [helicases](#helicase) which unwind double-stranded [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid).
