<a id="β_galactosidase_lactase_β_gal_beta_gal">β-Galactosidase (lactase, β-gal, beta-gal)</a> - Is a glycoside hydrolase enzyme which catalyses the breakdown of β-galactosides into monosaccharides. It is commonly used in molecular biology as a [reporter gene](#reporter) to monitor gene expression. Microorganisms, or other, producing this enzyme can break down [x-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside)](#x_gal), an artificial chromogenic substrate. Cleavage of this substrate produces a blue colour. It can be mixed in [petri dishes](#petri_dish); known as [blue/white screening](#blueWhiteScreening).

 This enzyme can be split into two complimentary peptides LacZα and LacZΩ; neither active by itself but together can break down [x-gal](#x_gal).
