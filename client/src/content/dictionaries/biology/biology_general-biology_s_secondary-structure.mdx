<a id="secondary_structure">Secondary Structure</a> - A secondary structure in a protein refers to the the three dimensional form which a [polypetidic](#protein) chain takes: either [α helices](#alpha_helix), [β sheets](#betaSheet), β turns, and even ω loops. See [protein](#protein) for an illustration.

 The [primary strucutre](#primaryStructure) refers to the sequence of [amino acids](#amino_acid) composing the chain, and the [tertiary strucutre](#tertiaryStructure) the association of secondary structures.
