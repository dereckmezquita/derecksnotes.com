<a id="kinase">Kinase</a> - An [enzyme](#enzyme) that adds a [phosphate group](#phosphateGroup) to some chemical moiety. For [enzymes](#enzyme), the resulting change in [phosphorylation](#phosphorylation) state can change the activity of the [enzyme](#enzyme) (reduce or increase it, change the substrate [affinity](#affinity), or change the reaction being [catalysed](#catalysation)). For [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid), a phosphate on the [5'](#5_prime_end_5) end of a piece of [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) is required for it to be ligated to another piece of [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid).
