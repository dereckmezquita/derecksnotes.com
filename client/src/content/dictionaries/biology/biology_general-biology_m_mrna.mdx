<a id="mrna">mRNA</a> - Messenger RNA is a functional [RNA](#rna) comprising [codons](#codon) to be [translated](#translation) by [ribosomes](#ribosome) to [proteins](#protein). In eukaryotic systems, mRNA that has not been processed is referred to as precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA). This pre-mRNA is typically processed through the removal of [introns](#intron), the addition of a [polyA tail](#poly_a_tail), and the addition of a [5' cap](#5PrimeCap) to create mature mRNA. Matured mRNA is what is translated by [ribosomes](#ribosome).
1. Mature Messenger RNA or mRNA has undergone the following steps.
2. [Introns](#intron) have been removed.
3. A [PolyA tail](#PolyATail) has been added to the [3'](#3_prime_end_3) end.
4. A [5' cap](#5PrimeCap) has been added to the [5'](#5_prime_end_5) end.
