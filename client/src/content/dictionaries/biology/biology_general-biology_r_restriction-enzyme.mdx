<a id="restriction_enzyme">Restriction Enzyme</a> - [Enzymes](#enzyme) that cut [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) in a site-specific manner. Typically, each restriction enzyme has a certain restriction site that it recognises. Standard restriction enzymes that cut within their recognition site are the basis of traditional [cloning](#cloning_molecular_cloning) methods. Type IIS restriction enzymes, such BsaI, cut at a location outside of their recognition site and enable [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) assembly without the producing scar regions. Type IIS restriction enzymes are the basis of [Golden Gate cloning](#golden_gate) methods.
