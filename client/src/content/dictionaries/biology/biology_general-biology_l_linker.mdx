<a id="linker">Linker</a> - A linker sequence is inserted between two [proteins](#protein) in a translational fusion in order to allow the two proteins to fold independently. This sequence is typically made of glycines and/or lysines, which are relatively flexible residues, forming a loose chain between the two [protein](#protein) domains.
