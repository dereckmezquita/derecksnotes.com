<a id="melting_temperature">Melting Temperature</a> - Melting temperature is referring the the dehybridisation temperature of [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) primers (most often). For calculating these temperatures, which are to be used when designating a [PCR](#polymerase_chain_reaction_pcr) protocol, the following formulas are to be used:

 For primers with a length inferiour to 14 nt the following is used:

 $$ Tm = (n(A) + n(T)) \cdot 2 + (n(G) + n(C)) \cdot 4 $$

 For primers with a length superiour to 13 nt the following is used:

 $$ Tm = 64.9 + 41 \cdot \frac{(n(G) + n(C) - 16.4)}{(n(A) + n(T) + n(G) + n(C))} $$

 Both these formulas assume the following: 50 nM primer, 50 mM Na+, and pH 7.0\. n(x) designates the number of whichever base.
