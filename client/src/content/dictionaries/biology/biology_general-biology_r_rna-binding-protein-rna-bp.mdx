<a id="rna_binding_protein_rna_bp">RNA Binding Protein (RNA-BP)</a> - A [protein](#protein) that binds to an [RNA](#rna) sequence as its substrate. Naturally, these [proteins](#protein) serve a variety of roles in post-[transcriptional](#transcription) regulation. Recently, bacteriophage coat [proteins](#protein) such as PP7 and MS2 have been used to target [RNA](#rna) sequences that have had RBP binding sites integrated into them. Fusion of these RBPs to [fluorescent proteins](#green_fluorescent_protein_gfp_egfp) allows the real-time monitoring of [mRNA](#mrna) [transcription](#transcription).
