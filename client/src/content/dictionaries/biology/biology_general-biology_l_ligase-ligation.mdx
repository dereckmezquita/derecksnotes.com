<a id="ligase_ligation">Ligase, Ligation</a> - A ligase is an [enzyme](#enzyme) that [catalyses](#catalysation) the formation of a covalent bond between large [molecules](#molecule), *exempli gratia* [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) or [RNA](#rna), for which it catalyses the formation of the phosphodiester bond in the backbone of the nucleic acid [polymer](#polymer) Ligases can use single-stranded or [double-stranded](#doubleStrand) (more common) [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) (or even [RNA](#rna)) as the [substrate](#substrate) but are often [substrate](#substrate) to the type of [substrate](#substrate), while not being sequence-specific. All commonly used ligases require a **5'** phosphate group on the [substrate](#substrate), which is absent from most synthetic [oligonucleotides](#oligonucleotide) and thus have to be specifically ordered as such or enzymatically phosphorylated with a [poly-nucleotide kinase (PNK)](#pnk).
