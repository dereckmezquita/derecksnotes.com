<a id="monotreme">Monotreme</a> - A mammal that lays eggs rather than giving live birth. Though laying eggs is a primitive reptilian trait, monotremes share many morphological, physiological, and reproductive characteristics with other mammals, making them true mammals. Extant monotremes include the duck-billed platypus and echidna.
