<a id="dextrose">Dextrose</a> - Dextrose is a form of sugar otherwise known as glucose. This kind is special in that it is used as fuel for life. The name dextrose denotes specifically the D [isomer](#isomer). Do not confuse dextrose with [desoxyribose](#desoxyribose), included in genetic material of [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid). In humans dextrose does not need to be [metabolised](#metabolism) and can be integrated and used directly in its current form by human cells.
