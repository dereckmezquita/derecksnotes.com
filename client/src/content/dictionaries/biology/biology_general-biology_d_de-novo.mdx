<a id="de_novo">*De Novo*</a> - From scratch. *exempli gratia:* *de novo* [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) synthesis is the synthesis of [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) from basic building blocks such as [nucleotides](#nucleotide) or [oligonucleotides](#oligonucleotide), instead of creating a new [DNA molecule](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) that is a copy of an existing [DNA molecule](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid); that would be templated synthesis.
