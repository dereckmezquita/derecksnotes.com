<a id="marsupial">Marsupial</a> - A mammal that gives live birth to young that have gestated for only a short period of time. The young usually crawl into a pouch (the marsupium) or protected area and attach to their motherâ€™s teat to finish developing. Examples of marsupials include kangaroos, opossums, and koalas.
