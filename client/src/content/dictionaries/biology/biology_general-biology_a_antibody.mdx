<a id="antibody">Antibody</a> - Also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a large, Y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralise pathogens such as [bacteria](#bacteria) and [viruses](#virus). The average size of an antibody is about 10 nm in length (Reth 2013: Nature Immunology - Matching cellular dimensions with molecular sizes) and its molecular weight would be about 150 kDa (Padlan EA. Anatomy of the antibody molecule. Mol. Immunol. 1994;31:169-217).
