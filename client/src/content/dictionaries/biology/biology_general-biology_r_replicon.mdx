<a id="replicon">Replicon</a> - A [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) or [RNA molecule](#rna) that replicates from a single [origin of replication](#origin_of_replication_ori). Most [prokaryotic](#prokaryote) [chromosomes](#chromosome) are a single replicon, while [eukaryotic](#eukaryota) [chromosomes](#chromosome) typically have multiple replicons. "Replicon" is sometimes used to describe self-amplifying [RNA](#rna)s (RepRNA), which have the ability to replicate themselves within a [transfected](#transfection) [cell](#cell) to provide continuous [protein](#protein) production.
