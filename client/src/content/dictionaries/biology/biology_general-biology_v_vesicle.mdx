<a id="vesicle">Vesicle</a> - Vesicles are [lipid bilayer](#lipidBilayer) structures that contain liquid and materials of interest. [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid), [RNA](#rna) and [proteins](#protein) can all be delivered to cultured cells using vesicles created in a mixture of the desired payload. As the vesicles form, they encapsulate the [nucleic acids](#nucleic_acid) and [proteins](#protein) in the mixture. The vesicles can merge with the cell outer layer or be [endocytosed](#endocytosis), both leading to the delivery of the payload (though through different biological mechanisms). Reagents are commercially available for this purpose, optimised for different payload types, amounts, and sizes.
