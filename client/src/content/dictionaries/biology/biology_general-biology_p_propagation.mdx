<a id="propagation">Propagation</a> - In terms of [plasmids](#plasmid), propagation is the ability of a [plasmid](#plasmid) to be replicated by its [host](#host) organism. A properly-propagating [plasmid](#plasmid) will have an [origin of replication](#origin_of_replication_ori) that is able to recruit the [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) replication machinery of the organism. A [plasmid](#plasmid) that does not propagate will ultimately be diluted out of a replicating [cell line](#cellLine) due to cellular divisions.
