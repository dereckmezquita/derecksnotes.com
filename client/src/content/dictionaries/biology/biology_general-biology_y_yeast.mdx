<a id="yeast">Yeast</a> - A class of mostly [unicellular](#unicellular) [eukaryotic](#eukaryota) organisms. These easy-to-culture organisms are often used in biology and [synthetic biology](#synthetic_biology) as test organisms or chassis. Commonly used yeast species include [*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*](#sachharomyces_cerevisiae) (brewer's yeast or baker's yeast; unlike other [eukaryotes](#eukaryota) it is missing the [RNAi](#rna_interference_rnai) machinery). Some notable species are *Kluyveromyces lactis* which can convert lactose to lactic acid, and *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* fission yeast; this yeast has [RNAi](#rna_interference_rnai) machinery.
