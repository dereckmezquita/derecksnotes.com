<a id="rna">RNA</a> - Ribonucleic acid; [polymeric molecules](#polymer) made up of [nucleotide](#nucleotide) monomers. RNA has many biological functions from information carrying ([mRNA](#mrna)) to [catalytic](#catalysation) activity ([ribozymes](#ribozyme)); its primary function however, is to transmit information from longterm storage ([DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid)) to active machinery [proteins](#protein). RNA is often found folded unto itself instead of in a [double strand](#doubleStrand) type; which is often the case with [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid). RNA is composed of 4 different kinds of [nucleotides](#nucleotide) with the [nitrogenous bases](#nitrogenous_base): A (Adenine), U (Uracil), C (Cytosine), and G (Guanine). RNA notably contains U instead of T (thymine) as [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) does. RNA also does not contain [desoxyribose](#desoxyribose) as [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) does but [ribose](#ribose) instead. The 18S [ribosomal RNA](#rrna) sequence has been used in many groups of organisms to reconstruct [phylogeny](#phylogeny).
