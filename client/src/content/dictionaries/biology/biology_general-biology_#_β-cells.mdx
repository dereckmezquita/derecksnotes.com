<a id="β_cells">β-Cells</a> - β-cells are a type of [cell](#cell) found in the pancreas, the pancreatic islets more precisely. These [cells](#cell) are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of [insulin](#insulin) and [amylin](#amylin).

 They make up around 50 - 70% of all the cells in the islets. People with type-I diabetes have their β-cells iradicated and thus produce no insulin.
