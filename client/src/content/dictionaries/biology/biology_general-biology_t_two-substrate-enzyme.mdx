<a id="two_substrate_enzyme">Two Substrate Enzyme</a> - An enzyme mechanism refers to the way a reaction occurs, that is the order of binding. Here we consider an enzyme that intakes two different substrates, the reaction can happen in five different ways:

Enzyme with two substrates can have various different mechanisms. Described by the diagrams, also shown the double inverses associated to the reactions and the substrates.

1. Sequential random dependent mechanism.
2. Sequential random independant mechanism.
3. Sequential ordered mechanism.
4. Ping-pong mechanism.
5. Theorell-Chance mechanism.
