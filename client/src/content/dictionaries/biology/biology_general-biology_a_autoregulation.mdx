<a id="autoregulation">Autoregulation</a> - Self-regulation. *exempli gratia*, an electric heater may employ negative autoregulation in order to keep a steady temperature in the room. If it heats the room too much, the room gets hot; a temperature sensor detects this and turns the heater off. Once the room cools down, the sensor detects this event as well and turns the heater on. The heater regulates itself in this way. [Gene expression](#geneExpression) is also autoregulatory; products regulate the expression of the gene (itself).
