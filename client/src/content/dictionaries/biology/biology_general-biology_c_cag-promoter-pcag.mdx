<a id="cag_promoter_pcag">CAG Promoter (pCAG)</a> - The CAG promoter is a strong [promoter](#promoter) for expressing proteins in mammalian cells. It is composed of [Cytolomegalovirus' (CMV)](#cmv) [promoter](#promoter) enhancer region, chicken β-Actin promoter its first [intron](#intron) and [exon](#exon), finally the rabbit β-Globin splice acceptor. Hence: **C**ytomegalovirus **A**ctin **G**lobin = CAG.
