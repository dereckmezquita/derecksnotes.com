<a id="stochastic">Stochastic</a> - Random, non-deterministic. A stochastic model enables modeling of discrete systems containing a small number of species, where deterministic, continuous models may give inappropriate predictions. Stochastic simulations enable predicting properties other than the mean, bulk behaviour of a system. Stochastic simulations can show unexpected properties of systems which deterministic-continuous models might not.
