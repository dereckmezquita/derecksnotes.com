<a id="escherichia_coli_e_coli">*Escherichia coli (E. coli)*</a> - A family of [bacteria](#bacteria). Certain [strains](#strain) of *E. coli* are favoured by scientist in labs, most often the [*K12 strain*](#e_coli_escherichia_coli_k12_strain). Some [strains](#strain) of *E. coli,* can be [pathogenic](#pathogenic) to humans. They have a small, \~4.6 [megabasepair](#base_pair_bp) circular genome, are easily [transformed](#transformation), and replicate fast. Cell replication can be made to be limited by controlling [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) replication through predetermined growth conditions.
