<a id="ultrastructure">Ultrastructure</a> - The detailed structure of a specimen, such as a cell, tissue, or organ, that can be observed only by electron microscopy. Also called fine structure. In eggshell, ultrastructure refers to the three-dimensional arrangement of mineral crystals and organic matter. It is described in terms of calcite or aragonite mineralogy and the transition between different zones of organization within the shell. Distinct zones of organization are called ultrastructure zones.
