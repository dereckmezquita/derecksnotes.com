<a id="timescale_separation">Timescale Separation</a> - A method for simplifying time-dependent systems. It is often the case that a system has processes which have timescales (how long it takes for the system to reach [equilibrium](#equilibrium)) differing by one or more orders of magnitude. For example, the timescale of [transcription factors](#transcription_factor_tf) binding to [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) is short, as the binding [equilibrium](#equilibrium) is reached within milliseconds or less. However, the process of producing a mature [protein](#protein) can take minutes or more. Hence, when analysing a system where both processes occur, the binding can be considered to be at [equilibrium](#equilibrium) when discussing how [protein](#protein) dynamics look.
