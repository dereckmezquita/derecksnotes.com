<a id="double_inverse_lineweaver_burk_plot_double_reciprocal_plot">Double inverse/Lineweaver-Burk plot/double reciprocal plot</a> - A graphical reprsentation of the Lineweaver-Burk equation used in enzyme cinetics. The plot allows us to derive useful information as to the nature of a [Michaelis-Menten](#michaelis_menten_kinetics) type reaction. The reciprocal of the formula is the following:

 $$ V = \frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m + [S]} $$ $$ \frac{1}{V} = \frac{K_m + [S]}{V_{max}[S]} = \frac{K_m}{V_{max}} \cdot \frac{1}{[S]} + \frac{1}{V_{max}} $$

An example of the double inverse plot. Multiple points must be calculated from the resulting formula. The condition that varies is concetration of the substrate experimentally: 1/\[s\].

 Note that this equation's simplified form comes out to the form Y = Ax + B. This can be described as a linear curve on a graph as shown.

 This method can be used to determine enzyme cinetics: Km, Vmax. The y-intercept of the graph is equivalent to the inverse of Vmax, and the x-intercept represents -1/KVm.

Enzyme inhibition shown using the double inverse. The different motifs formed by the curves allows us to deduce the type of inhibiton.

 These representations also allow us to visualise the different forms of [enzyme inhibition](#inhibition).
