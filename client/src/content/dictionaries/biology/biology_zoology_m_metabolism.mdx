<a id="metabolism">Metabolism</a> - The chemical processes within an organic body that supply the energy necessary for life. The rate of metabolic processes is sometimes used as a way to differentiate organisms. For example, mammals generally have a higher metabolism than reptiles and can thus sustain higher levels of activity for longer periods of time.
