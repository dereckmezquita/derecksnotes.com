<a id="overhang">Overhang</a> - A short stretch of single-stranded [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) that "hangs off" a region of double-stranded [double-stranded DNA](#doubleStrand). Two overhangs are compatible if they can anneal to form a [double-stranded DNA](#doubleStrand) with no gaps (there can be nicks in the [backbone](#backbone) but no missing [basepairs](#base_pair_bp)).
