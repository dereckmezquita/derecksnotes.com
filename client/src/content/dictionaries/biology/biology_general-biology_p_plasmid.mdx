<a id="plasmid">Plasmid</a> - A relatively small circular piece of [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) found in prokaryotes. These pieces of DNA are versatile and can be exchanged intra-species and inter-species; horizontal and vertical exchange respecitively.

 These are usually on the order of tens of kilobases or less. Typical features of a plasmid include the [origin of replication (ORI)](#origin_of_replication_ori), a multiple cloning site, and a marker; such as an antibiotic resistance gene (in a lab setting).
