<a id="rna_seq">RNA-Seq</a> - [RNA](#rna) [sequencing](#sequencing). A method of obtaining a snapshot of genetic [transcripts](#transcription) present in an organism. [mRNA](#mrna)s can be isolated from a [cell](#cell) by their [polyA tail](#PolyATail) and then [reverse transcribed](#rtpcr) into [cDNA](#rtpcr). [Next-generation sequencing](#next_gen_sequencing) methods can then be used to [sequence](#sequencing) this [cDNA](#rtpcr), which allows the reconstruction of the [cell](#cell)'s [transcriptome](#transcriptome).
