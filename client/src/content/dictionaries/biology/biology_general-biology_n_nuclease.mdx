<a id="nuclease">Nuclease</a> - An [enzyme](#enzyme) that creates a cut in the [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) [backbone](#backbone); [RNA](#rna) in some cases. Some [nucleases](#nuclease) are sequence specific, others are not. Some depend on the [methylation](#methylation) state or other modifications of the substrate [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid). There are two main categories of nucleases, see [endonuclease](#endonuclease), and [exonuclease](#exonuclease).
