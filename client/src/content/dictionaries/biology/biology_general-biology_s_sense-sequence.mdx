<a id="sense_sequence">Sense Sequence</a> - [Positive RNA](#positive_rna_rna) is the [RNA](#rna) version of sense [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) (also called positive); this strand would be [translateable](#translation) into a [protein](#protein). A sense sequence of [nucleotides](#nucleotide) is complementary to an [antisense coding sequence](#antisense_sequence).
