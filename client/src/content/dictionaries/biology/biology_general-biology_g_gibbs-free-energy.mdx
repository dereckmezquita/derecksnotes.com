<a id="gibbs_free_energy">Gibbs Free Energy</a> - A state function discovered by Josiah Willard Gibbs called Gibbs Free Energy, Free [Enthalpy](#enthalpy), or G. This function is written at a given temperature as such: $$ \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S $$.

[Exothermic](#exothermic) reactions are instances where [heat](#heat) is liberated from the [system](#system); in this case [enthalpy](#enthalpy) is negative (Δ\<H). These systems are inherently unstable and thus spontaneous reactions.

[Endothermic](#endothermic) reactions are instances where [heat](#heat) is absorbed by the [system](#system); in this case [enthalpy](#enthalpy) is positve (Δ\>H).
