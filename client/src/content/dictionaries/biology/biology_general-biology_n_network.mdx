<a id="network">Network</a> - A group of two or more interacting [sub-units](#subUnit). Each [sub-units](#subUnit) is called a node and the interactions between nodes are termed edges. Networks can be used to describe many different systems. [Protein-protein](#protein) interaction networks have [proteins](#protein) as nodes and the edges between them can be binding interactions. Microbiome studies may describe microbial species as nodes and define the edges as influences on growth rate.
