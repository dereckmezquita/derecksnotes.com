<a id="motif">Motif</a> - A commonly-reproduced pattern that has a similiar function across multiple systems. Examples of regulatory network motifs are negative [autoregulation](#autoregulation) and [feed-forward loops](#ffl). [Nucleotide](#nucleotide) sequence motifs are commonly-found sequences of nucleotides that may serve as [transcription factor](#transcription_factor_tf) binding sites. [Amino acid](#amino_acid) sequence motifs may reproduce common [protein](#protein) structures such as [alpha helices](#alpha_helix).
