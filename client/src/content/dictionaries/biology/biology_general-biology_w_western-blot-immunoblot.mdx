<a id="western_blot_immunoblot">Western Blot (immunoblot)</a> - A lab technique used for detecting the expression of specific [proteins](#protein) in a tissue sample or extract.

 The first step is generally to migrate the proteins by a classic [electrophoretic gel](#electrophoresis), then to "blot" the gel with a membrane (normally nitrocellulose or polyvinyldene fluoride) which holds [antibodies](#antibody) specific to the [protein](#protein) of interest. This will only reveal the bands which contained said [protein](#protein).
