<a id="specificity">Specificity</a> - How well a method can distinguish between true positives and false positives; also called the true negative rate and calculated by dividing the number of true negatives by the number of true negatives added to the number of false positives.

$$
    Specificity = \frac{(True Negatives)}{(True Negatives) + (False Positives)}
$$

Often at odds with [sensitivity](#sensitivity) (increasing specificity typically decreases [sensitivity](#sensitivity); this can be observed with a receiver operating characteristic curve, which plots 1 minus specificity against [sensitivity](#sensitivity)).
