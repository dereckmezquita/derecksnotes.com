<a id="enveloped_virus">Enveloped Virus</a> - A [virus](#virus) that has an outer wrapping known as an envelope. These [viruses](#virus) are wrapped in what was before the [host](#host)'s [plasma membrane](#lipidBilayer) which is obtained in a process known as budding-off. Typically enveloped viruses are much weaker when exposed to the environment and need a host to survive. They do not survive on sterile surfaces.
