<a id="scaffold">Scaffold</a> - A structure on which elements can be brought together to be close in space. For example, the [enzymes](#enzyme) involved in the same pathway can be brought together in proximity on an [RNA scaffold](#rna) by fusing the [enzymes](#enzyme) with [RNA](#rna)\-binding [proteins](#protein) and thus increase the efficiency of the pathway, as [substrates](#substrate) do not need to [diffuse](#diffusion) far to reach the next [enzyme](#enzyme) in the pathway.
