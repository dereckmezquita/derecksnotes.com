<a id="cooperativity">Cooperativity</a> - The ability for binding events to [promote](#promoter) additional binding events. *Exempli gratia* the binding of the first [oxygen molecule](#CDic_oxygen) to [hemoglobin](#hemoglobin) makes the binding of the second [oxygen molecule](#CDic_oxygen) much more likely, which in turn makes the binding of the third [molecule](#molecule) much more likely, *et cetera*. We often want to use [repressors](#repressor) that exhibit cooperativity, as they exhibit a non-linear ([exponential](#MDic_exponential)) response useful for creating devices that can be analysed with the digital abstraction.
