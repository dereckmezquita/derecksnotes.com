<a id="hemoglobin">Hemoglobin</a> - An [iron](#CDic_iron) containing [metalloprotein](#metalloProtein) complex which is essential for bonding, transporting, and distributing oxygen throughout the body. This protein complex circulates in the blood of most chordates and the roots of certain legumes; in chordates this is the means by which oxygen is delivered to the cells.
