<a id="riboswitch">Riboswitch</a> - A [cis](#trans_cis)\-acting regulatory element found in [mRNA](#mrna) transcripts. Riboswitches form structures whose [conformations](#conformation) are affected by small [molecules](#molecule). These [conformational](#conformation) changes have the ability to turn expression of a transcript "ON" or "OFF". This switching is accomplished through a variety of mechanisms.
