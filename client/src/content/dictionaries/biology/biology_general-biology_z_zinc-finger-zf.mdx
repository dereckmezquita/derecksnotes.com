<a id="zinc_finger_zf">Zinc Finger (ZF)</a> - A [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) binding protein motif, often seen in [transcription factors](#transcription_factor_tf). In the folded motif, a zinc ion is coordinated by [amino acid](#amino_acid) helices and sheets. Many motifs bind sequence-specifically (3-4 [base pairs](#base_pair_bp)) and can be combined together to bind longer sequences (9-12 basepairs). While a "code" exist (mapping of motifs to sequences), technologies like [TALEs](#taleS) or [CRISPR/Cas9](#crispr_cas9) are often preferred for engineering [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) binding [proteins](#protein), as the code is more clear and specific in these; increasing the rate of success.
