<a id="oligo_oligomer_oligonucleotide">Oligo (Oligomer/Oligonucleotide)</a> - Short [polymers](#polymer) of [nucleotides](#nucleotide) usually less than 200 [nucleotides](#nucleotide) in length. They are typically chemically synthesized and have many uses in biotechnology. [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) oligos can be used as [primers](#primer) for [PCR](#polymerase_chain_reaction_pcr), targets in [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) microarrays, and as probes for [Southern blots](#southern_blot). Oligonucleotides can also refer to very short strands of [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) composed of some 10 [nucleotides](#nucleotide).
