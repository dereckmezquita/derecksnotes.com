<a id="modrna">modRNA</a> - Modified [mRNA](#mrna). Synthetic, chemically-modified [mRNA](#mrna) that can be transfected into [cells](#cell) to induce expression of a [protein](#protein) of interest. Chemical modifications at the [5'](#5_prime_end_5) end allow the [transcript](#transcription) to evade harmful immune responses and prevent it from being degraded thus allowing prolonged protein expression.
