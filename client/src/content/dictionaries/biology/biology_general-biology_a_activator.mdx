<a id="activator">Activator</a> - A [protein](#protein) that binds [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) and [promotes](#promoter) the [transcription](#transcription) of nearby [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) (often directionally, on one side of the binding site, but sometimes bidirectionally). An activator can do this by recruiting [RNA polymerase (RNA-P)](#rna_polymerase_rna_p), opening a cell's [chromatin](#chromatin) allowing access to the [promoter](#promoter) region by [RNA-P](#rna_polymerase_rna_p) (in [eukaryota](#eukaryota)). This blocks a [repressor](#repressor) from binding.
