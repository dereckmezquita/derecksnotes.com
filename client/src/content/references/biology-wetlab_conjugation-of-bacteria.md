For this process we will try to get one plasmid to pass into another strain. This can be done for different reasons including: testing conjugative capacity, and preparing for a &lambda;<sub>red</sub> recombination.

The protocol for this process is the following:

1. Have previously prepared LB cultures of both strains to conjugate.
2. Sample 500 &mu;L of each LB culture and place together into a new 1.5 mL eppendorf.
3. Centrifuge for 2-3 mins at 13 000 g.
4. Eliminate the surnatant.
5. Resuspend in 1 ml of LB.
6. Centrifuge for 2-3 mins at 13 000g.
7. Prepare a conjugation filter with 45 &mu;m pores.
    - Work in a sterile environment, with Bunsen burner.
    - Use tweezers to carefully remove the filter from its case and place it onto a LA dish; no antibiotics.
    - Allow the filer to adhere to the LA surface and become humid. Do not disturb after this point.
8. Eliminate the surnatant.
9. Resuspend in 10 &mu;L of LB.
10. Carefully deposit all 10 &mu;L of the solution onto the filter.
11. Carefully spread it on the filter surface with the tip of a cone.
12. Leave to dry with the lid ajar for a few seconds.
13. Incubate at 30&deg;C for 1 h 30 mins.
14. Recover the filter and place it into a 1.5 mL eppendorf.
15. Add 300 &mu;L of LB.
16. Vortex.
17. Throw away the filter.
18. Create cascading dilutions of the resulting solution. For help with dilutions please see here: [Cascading Dilutions](/dictionaries/dicFormulas.html#FDic_Cascading_Dilutions).
19. Smear with glass beads onto LA dish with combined antibiotics of the respective resistances for the individual strains.

Depending on what strain you are using is what temperature you would incubate at.
