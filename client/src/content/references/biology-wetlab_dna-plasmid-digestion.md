Here we will take a plasmid, pAPT110 as an example, and cut it with the Nhe1 restriction enzyme. The cut is being made just before the KmR cassette as seen in the image below.

For this process we require the following materials in the following quantities:

- Prime Star PCR vf = 50 μL

| Product                                | Amount |
|----------------------------------------|--------|
| Nhe1 Restriction Enzyme x2             | 1 μL   |
| MQ H₂O water                           | 26 μL  |
| Plasmid DNA                            | 10 μL  |
| Tampon x10 Thermo Fisher Scientific    | 3 μL   |

Note these quantities are guildlines and are specific to this Nhe1 restriction enzyme by Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Make sure the restriction sequence only appears once on the plasmid; in this case we use Nhe1.

Simply place the products into a 1.5 mL tube, and incubate with agitation at 37&deg;C unless cells require otherwise (&lambda;red). Afterwards recover the tube, and purify to avoid any unspecific restrictions.
