Glycerol stock prep allows us to store bacterial strains for the long term. In order to do this we must work in sterile conditions and place them into an innert/nutritive environment.

In order to make the glycerol stock of a strain you must prepare an LB culture in advance. Or you can do the culture the same day by making the LB culture in a smaller volume and in the very morning.

The steps for this process are the following:

Work in sterile conditions using a Bunsen burner. Place 300 &mu;L of 87% glycerol and 1 mL of LB into a freeze tube. Then take a wooden stick and dip it into the LB culture. Place the stick into the tube and agitate. Vortex to mix and then freeze at -80&deg;C for long term storage.

Use a freeze, as shown, resistant tube for this process. Make sure that all materials are sterile before use.
