Petri dish smears should follow a specific protocol. This in order to evenly spread the cells over a nutrient rich gel. Depending on what is being done we could be trying to isolate certain strains or just test them against an antibiotic.

We previously prepared Petri dishes, new let's look at how to put something of interest on said dishes for culture.

For this process you will need the following:

- Previously prepared Petri dishes
- Bunsen burner
- Long wooden sticks

## Protocol

Take one of the wooden sticks and sterilise it over the flame of a bunsen burner. Then dip or touch the stick gently to the sample to be smeared.

Place this end gently onto the gel of a petri dish to be used. And slowly smear the stick in a back and forth motion in more or less the same spot. 

Turn the dish about 30&deg; and again smear the stick in this same motion. This time though pass the stick in the previous path only once.

Again take turn the dish and repeat the process until you come full circle back to the previously smeared path.
