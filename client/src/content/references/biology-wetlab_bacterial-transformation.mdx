Here we look at how to transform bacteria with new plasmids. Transformation is the act of introducing a DNA sequence into the cells. We use chemocompetent cells in this case, a strain commonly used is DH5&alpha;.

For this process we needed to always work in ice, and the following materials:

- Genetic constructions to transform into cells.
- DH5&alpha; cells. These should be carefully handled as they are fragile.
- Ice tray.
- Hot bath, 42&deg;C.
- An incubator with agitation.
- Petri dishes with appropriate antibiotics.

The process is rather straight forward. Here is what was done.

- Add 8 &mu;L of DNA construction (from InFusion reaction). It is important to add this DNA in order to obtain about 0.01-0.1 &mu;g of DNA in the final solution.
- Incubate in ice for 20-30 mins. Agitate lightly from time to time.
- Incubate in hot bath, 42&deg;C for 1 min 30 s.
- Plunge into the ice and leave for 5 mins.
- Add 1 mL of LB medium to the tube, agitate lightly.
- Finally incubate at 37&deg;C for 1 h to allow for phenotypic expression.

This phenotypic expression being the resistance to our selective antibiotics.

Place between 50-100 &mu;L of the cell's solution directly onto a dish and smear with glass beads.
