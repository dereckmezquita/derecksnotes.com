This page serves as a reference point for bacterial origins of replication. These are points in bacterial chromosomes/plasmids where DNA replication starts from. These points are of interest we must track the origin of replication (ori) so we may build compatible plasmids for use in bacterial transformation/genetic engineering.

## **E. coli**

Common origins of replication (ori) used in **E. coli. Never put two plasmids with the same origin of replication in the same cell. Check compability; careful that two different oris are not just a few nucleotides different.

If you put two plasmids with the same replication mechanism, they will compete with each other and one will eventually be lost.

1. pMB1: 100 - 200 copies.
1. pBR322: 50 copies.
1. pSC1: 10 copies.
