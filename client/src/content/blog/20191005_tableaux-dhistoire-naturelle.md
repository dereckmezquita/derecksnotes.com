Some posters I had since 2014, these posters date from the mid 1800s. They are on the anatomy of a variety of animals. These posters have been digitised by the University of Artois in France. Unfortuantely I had to part ways with them the 30th of September 2019, now in the possession of Julien Perochon.

These posters have been digitised by the University of Artois in France[^1].
