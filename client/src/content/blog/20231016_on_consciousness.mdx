For thousands of years philosophers and then scientists have pondered consciousness. Some explain it to be some mystic force that comes to reside in a physical body, others explain it as an emergent property of complex information systems. However, none give a mechanism by which consciousness arises. Here are three of the most popular theories:

1. Emergent Property of Brain Complexity: Many neuroscientists believe that consciousness emerges from the complexity and interconnectedness of brain networks. As the brain processes information, the interaction between different neural networks gives rise to conscious experience.
1. Dualistic Perspective: Historically, philosophers like Ren√© Descartes posited that consciousness arises from a non-physical mind interacting with the physical brain.
1. Integrated Information Theory: This theory proposes that consciousness is a property that emerges when information is processed in a highly integrated and differentiated manner. The more integrated and differentiated a system, the higher its level of consciousness.

I propose a radical new idea: **consciousness does not exist.**

I believe consciousness to be nothing more than an illusion crafted by the interconnected networks within our brain? In this post, I'll delve into the foundation of this idea, presenting arguments and evidence that support this perspective.

**I believe that we are biased!** We want consciousness to exist, we want to believe we are special, we want to believe that we are exempt from a Turing test simply because we are Human. But I believe that we are not special, we are just a complex system that has evolved to be able to process information in a way that allows us to survive; the side effect of this is the illusion of something special, consciousness.

## Solipsism; welcome to the Matrix

Solipsism is a philosophical concept that asserts the only thing one can be sure of is the existence of one's own mind. Everything else, the external world, other people, and even time, could potentially be illusions or constructs of an individual's mind.

The question naturally comes, what can we do to combat this idea? What tools do we have to determine real?

- **Platonic Realism:**
    - Suggests that abstract objects/ideas like numbers, mathematical sets, and shapes exist objectively and independent of human perception.
    - Proposed by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato.
    - Strength: offers a perspective that some aspects of our world exist in a timeless, non-physical realm of Forms or Ideas, providing an objective basis for certain elements of reality.
- **Empirical Testing and Objectivity:**
    - Relies on repeatable experiments and observations to build a shared understanding of the world.
    - Proposed by scientists and rationalists.
    - Strength: provides a consistent and verifiable method to understand the world.
- **Inter-subjectivity:**
    - Shared language and communication imply the existence of a common world.
    - Proposed by philosophers such as Edmund Husserl.
    - Strength: demonstrates how our shared experiences and language indicate a common reality.

We ultimately are limited in tools to combat solipsism especially when it comes to addressing the **"realness"** of other individuals/*conscious* entities.

Accepting certain axioms such as logic seem necessary and, even if we ignore the problem of the *dream/The Matrix* that holds us we seek to determine what is consciousness - that question leads us to test others around us.

The only tool we have left is the Turing.

If we can't be sure that others are real, then should we not apply a Turing test to other people as we do to machines? The Turing test is devised to test a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Eventually we are left with the question - what does the Turing test test? Consciousness or merely responsiveness to a stimuli in a pertinent way?

We readily exempt other humans from the need to pass a Turing test. It's as if we've collectively decided that being human is enough to guarantee the presence of consciousness, and only machines are to be questioned. But I suggest we question all; even oneself!

Why indeed you, the reader, exempt from such a test? What makes you so sure that you are real, that your consciousness is not an illusion? I argue that you are not exempt.

You, like me, are a complex information processing system, biological we may be - but that gives no innate merit as we spring from Carbon the same way computers spring from Silicon. We have evolved to process information and computers were designed to do so. Why is one more special than the other?

Finally my proposed idea is that our consciousness is an accident. A side effect of this evolutionary development; an illusion of a complex information processing system. An illusion so convincing that we never question the reality of our own thoughts and experiences. But if you release your biases and let go of the idea that you are somehow special and instead seek objective truth you can see that despite your discomfort with the idea, you cannot dispute it.

Points to write about in this section:

- What is solipsism?
- If we can't be sure that others are real, what can we do?
    - Why not apply a Turing test to other people?
    - What does a Turing test demonstrate; consciousness or responsiveness in a pertinent way?
    - Why only apply Turing tests to machines? Why are other people exempt from having to pass the test?
    - It is an unsolvable problem: determining real, and the problem with determining consciousness.
- Why are yourself exempt from a Turing test? What makes you so sure you're real?
- I argue you are not exempt.

Solipsism is a philosophical theory that posits that nothing can be known for sure beyond the existence of one's own mind. This concept highlights the inherent subjectivity of perception and challenges our assumptions about the reality of the external world and the existence of other minds. In essence, solipsism suggests that we might all be living in our own personal Matrix, unable to truly verify the existence of anything beyond our own consciousness.

This theory may seem extreme, but it underscores a crucial point: our experience of consciousness is deeply individual and subjective. When we perceive the world around us, we are not directly experiencing objective reality, but rather our brain's interpretation of sensory information. The colors we see, the sounds we hear, and the emotions we feel are all products of complex neural processes that translate external stimuli into our subjective experience.

This concept dovetails with my argument that consciousness is an illusion. If our perceptions of the world are fundamentally subjective and potentially unreliable, then the sense of self and awareness that we derive from these perceptions is similarly illusory. Just as our brains interpret sensory data to create our experience of the world, they also weave together our thoughts, memories, and emotions to create the illusion of a continuous, coherent consciousness. This illusion is so convincing that we take it for granted, never questioning the reality of our own thoughts and experiences.

In conclusion, just as solipsism challenges our assumptions about the external world, my theory challenges the very existence of consciousness as we understand it. Rather than being a mystical force or an emergent property of complex information processing, consciousness may be nothing more than a convincing illusion crafted by our brains. This perspective opens up new avenues for understanding the nature of self-awareness, perception, and reality itself.


## The Theory's Foundation: Brain's Multifaceted Communication 

Our brain, a marvel of evolution, comprises billions of neurons connected through intricate pathways. These connections form distinct networks, each responsible for a unique aspect of our cognitive functions. But, crucially, these networks don't operate in isolation. They're in a state of constant communication, transferring and sharing information. My hypothesis posits that our sensation of consciousness arises from this very phenomenon: when one network observes, interacts with, or checks in on another.

## Dismantling the Illusion: Arguments & Evidence

### 1. **Neurological Synchronization**:
When we employ tools like fMRI to observe the brain in action, we notice specific regions 'lighting up' simultaneously when exposed to certain stimuli. This simultaneous activation across distinct networks may be the neural basis for what we interpret as a conscious experience.

### 2. **Emergent Properties in Simulations**:
By leveraging the power of computational models, I've observed that even basic simulations of neural networks can exhibit emergent properties when these networks are made to interact. Such emergence could be an analog of how our perception of consciousness arises.

### 3. **Split-brain Research**:
Studies on patients with severed corpus callosum (to treat epilepsy) have shown that they exhibit two discrete conscious experiences, suggesting that our unified sense of self might not be as solid as previously thought. Instead, it might be a conjured experience from the different interactions of brain networks.

### 4. **Evolutionary Argument**:
From an evolutionary standpoint, it might be more efficient for our brain to operate as a series of networks, constantly communicating, rather than housing a central seat of consciousness. This decentralized approach could offer better adaptive responses to our environment.

### 5. **Dream States**:
Consider our dream states where our brain conjures vivid, often surreal experiences. The dream state could be an exaggerated manifestation of these network interactions, further hinting at the distributed nature of our conscious experiences.

### 6. **Hallucinations and Altered States**:
Psychedelic research has shown that substances like psilocybin or LSD increase the communication between brain networks that don't typically interact. The altered states of consciousness during these experiences could be direct evidence of how increased cross-talk can shape our conscious perception.

## Implications & The Path Forward

If this theory holds water, it would radically alter our understanding of the self and consciousness. No longer would we view consciousness as a singular, continuous experience, but as a dynamic, emergent property of our neural networks' interactions.

But this is just the beginning. This perspective opens up a myriad of questions: Can we induce or modify conscious experiences by altering these network interactions? What does this mean for our understanding of self and identity?

I urge the scientific community to approach this theory with an open mind and rigor. Let's challenge our longstanding beliefs, for in such challenges often lie the most profound discoveries.
