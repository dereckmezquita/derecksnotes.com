For thousands of years philosophers and then scientists have pondered consciousness. Some explain it to be some mystic force that comes to reside in a physical body, others explain it as an emergent property of complex information systems. However, none give a mechanism by which consciousness arises. In this exploration, I propose a radical hypothesis: consciousness is an illusion.

## What is consciousness?

First here are some of the more popular theories of consciousness.

1. **Physicalist theories**

    1. **Materialism**: Asserts that consciousness arises solely from physical processes within the brain, a view supported by modern neuroscience through empirical evidence.

    1. **Neurobiological Theories**: Focus on identifying specific neurobiological processes and brain structures responsible for consciousness, often through the study of neural correlates of consciousness (NCC).

    1. **Quantum Theories**: Controversially posits that quantum processes in neurons might give rise to consciousness, but lacks wide acceptance and empirical support.

1. **Fundamental property theories**

    1. **Dualism**: Advocated by René Descartes, it posits that mind and body are fundamentally different, with the mind (or soul) being non-physical and the seat of consciousness.

    1. **Panpsychism**: Suggests that consciousness is a fundamental and universal feature, present even in elementary particles, implying that everything has some form of consciousness.

1. **Emergent/integrative theories**

    1. **Global Workspace Theory**: Likens consciousness to a spotlight that illuminates certain mental processes for cognitive processing, arising from the integration of neural processes.

    1. **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**: Proposes that consciousness correlates with a system's ability to integrate information, where consciousness is determined by the interaction and integration among system components.

    1. **Emergentism**: Suggests that consciousness emerges from complex interactions of simpler processes, with new properties arising in complex systems that are not evident in individual components.


Notice how we can categorize these theories:

- Physicalist theories suggest a direct correlation between consciousness and physical processes in the brain.
- Fundamental property theories view consciousness as an intrinsic, possibly non-physical aspect of reality.
- Emergent/integrative theories consider consciousness as a product of complex systems and information integration.

Thees theories look to give and explain the mechanism by which consciousness arises but none explain what it actually is.

> What are we studying; how do you define it?
>
> How do we study and communicate on something which is internal?
>
> Are those around us conscious? How do we know?

This is truely the **hard problem** and why I believe it will be relegated to a question of philosophy rather than science.

I will be very precise here: **I believe that science will seek to explain and study the mechanisms and conditions by which consciousness arises, but it will never be able to address what it is. Consciousness is by its very nature subjective.**

The best science will do is to define consciousness as:

<Blockquote>
    Consciousness is the state or quality of awareness or of being aware of an external object or something within oneself.
</Blockquote>

In short since we cannot see the the within we say science defines consciousness as: *the ability to take an input and create an output which we as observers deem logical.*

## Consciousness the illusion theory

I open with this idea, that **consciousness is an illusion**. What do I mean by this?

I believe that consciousness can be explained by materialism and emergent/integrative theories. I believe that it is simply a side effect of a complex information processing system.

I build my idea on the latter, and push it further to its logical conclusion: **consciousness does not exist.**

I do indeed believe that complex information systems do indeed come to exhibit characteristics of what we call consciousness. But the search for what is consciousness, I believe this to be a fools endeavour. We believe to perceive something, that we are *conscious* but I argue that it is simply an illusion.

Our bodies come from physical space, our *consciousness* is built on a physical body. There is nothing special about our perceived *consciousness* in the same way there is nothing special about our bodies.

<Blockquote src="Tyler Durden">
    You are not special. You're not a beautiful and unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else. We're all part of the same compost heap.
</Blockquote>

Let go of your biases. **You are not special.** I've noticed the human instinct to argue that consciousness is special. I believe this arises because people see consciousness as the essence of what makes them Human, what makes them real; what makes their soul.

Humans often see themselves as a *consciousness* living in a body, thus we insitinctively protect the idea of consciousness. We want to believe we are special, we want to believe that we are exempt of questioning!

> **I** am real, **I** know **I'm** real...

But I believe that we are not special, we are just a complex system that has evolved to be able to process information in a way that allows us to survive; the side effect of this, is the illusion of something special: consciousness.

## Solipsism; welcome to the Matrix

Solipsism is a philosophical concept that asserts that the only thing one can be certain of is the existence of one's own mind. Everything else, the external world, other people, and even time, are potentially illusions or constructs.

So nothing is real? Is that it? Really, is there no way of testing or proving anything? What tools do we have to determine **real**?

- **Platonic Realism:**
    - Suggests that abstract objects/ideas like numbers, mathematical sets, and shapes exist objectively and independent of human perception.
    - Proposed by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato.
    - Strength: offers a perspective that some aspects of our world exist in a timeless, non-physical realm of Forms or Ideas, providing an objective basis for certain elements of reality.
    - Flaws: relies on the existence of a non-physical realm, and proves very little about our physical world.
- **Empirical Testing and Objectivity:**
    - Relies on repeatable experiments and observations to build a shared understanding of the world.
    - Proposed by scientists and rationalists.
    - Strength: provides a consistent and verifiable method to understand the world.
    - Flaws: relies on the assumption that our senses and instruments are reliable; yet our senses and instruments live within the very cage we seek to test.
- **Inter-subjectivity:**
    - Shared language and communication imply the existence of a common world.
    - Proposed by philosophers such as Edmund Husserl.
    - Strength: demonstrates how our shared experiences and language indicate a common reality.
    - Flaws: allows us to prove the existence of a shared reality, but not necessarily an objective one.

Notice how these tools help us in testing the external world, but not the internal one; especially not the internal world of other conscious entities.

We could argue about the reality of reality forever, but at some point we must accept certain axioms to navigate the "dream/The Matrix" we find ourselves in. The real question at hand is consciousness.

## Consciousness mirage hypothesis; welcome to the dream

The exploration of consciousness brings us face-to-face with the limitations of our current scientific methodologies. When we consider the available tools to measure or assess consciousness each is fraught with its own set of limitations.

1. **Neuroscientific Methods:**
    - Tools: fMRI, EEG
    - Limitation: These methods can show correlations between brain activity and conscious states, but they don't directly measure consciousness itself.
1. **Behavioral Tests:**
   - Tools: Glasgow Coma Scale, other responsiveness tests
   - Limitation: These tests measure physical responses to stimuli and do not measure consciousness itself but simply the ability to respond to stimuli.
1. **Phenomenological Reporting:**
   - Tools: Subjective reports on experiences
   - Limitation: Relies heavily on self-reporting, which can be subjective and unreliable.
1. **Information Integration:**
   - Tools: Measures of information integration
   - Limitation: While there's a correlation between information integration and the level of consciousness we've observed in different animals/entities, it again doesn't provide a direct measurement of consciousness.

These methodologies, despite their innovative and sophisticated approaches, all grapple with a fundamental problem: they measure conditions or behaviors correlated with consciousness, not consciousness itself. This dichotomy brings us to a pivotal realisation: the exploration of consciousness may be more suited to the realms of philosophy and spirituality rather than scientific inquiry.

The essence of consciousness the subjective experience, the 'what it feels like' component— remains an enigma, potentially beyond the grasp of objective measurement. This raises a profound question: is consciousness a mystery that can ever be unraveled through empirical investigation, or will it forever remain an intriguing puzzle, best left to philosophical discourse and introspective reflection?

The Turing test, is designed to assess a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to a human's, becomes our primary tool. If we question the realness of others, shouldn't we apply the Turing test to them too? Why exempt humans from this test?

We readily exempt other humans from the need to pass a Turing test. It's as if we've collectively decided that being human is enough to guarantee the presence of consciousness, and only machines are to be questioned. But I suggest we question all; even oneself!

Why indeed, why should you the reader, be exempt from such a test? What makes you so sure that you are real, that your consciousness is not an illusion?

You, like me, are a complex information processing system, biological we may be - but that gives no innate merit as we spring from Carbon the same way computers spring from Silicon. We have evolved to process information and computers were designed to do so. Why is one more special than the other?

But even if we all were to pass the Turing test, what have we proven? Eventually we are left with the question - what does the Turing test actually test? Consciousness or merely responsiveness to a stimuli in a pertinent way? I believe it is the latter.

Consciousness is an accident. A side effect of this evolutionary development; an illusion of a complex information processing system. An illusion so convincing that we never question the reality of our own thoughts and experiences. But if you release your biases and let go of the idea that you are somehow special and instead seek objective truth you can see that despite your discomfort with the idea, you cannot dispute it.

This theory may seem extreme, but it underscores a crucial point: our experience of consciousness is deeply individual and subjective. When we perceive the world around us, we are not directly experiencing objective reality, but rather our brain's interpretation of sensory information. The colors we see, the sounds we hear, and the emotions we feel are all products of complex neural processes that translate external stimuli into our subjective experience.

This concept dovetails with my argument that consciousness is an illusion. If our perceptions of the world are fundamentally subjective and potentially unreliable, then the sense of self and awareness that we derive from these perceptions is similarly illusory. Just as our brains interpret sensory data to create our experience of the world, they also weave together our thoughts, memories, and emotions to create the illusion of a continuous, coherent consciousness. This illusion is so convincing that we take it for granted, never questioning the reality of our own thoughts and experiences.

In conclusion, just as solipsism challenges our assumptions about the external world, my theory challenges the very existence of consciousness as we understand it. Rather than being a mystical force or an emergent property of complex information processing, consciousness may be nothing more than a convincing illusion crafted by our brains. This perspective opens up new avenues for understanding the nature of self-awareness, perception, and reality itself and more importantly frees us from wasting our time and energy investigating a moot point.


## The Theory's Foundation: Brain's Multifaceted Communication 

Our brain, a marvel of evolution, comprises billions of neurons connected through intricate pathways. These connections form distinct networks, each responsible for a unique aspect of our cognitive functions. But, crucially, these networks don't operate in isolation. They're in a state of constant communication, transferring and sharing information. My hypothesis posits that our sensation of consciousness arises from this very phenomenon: when one network observes, interacts with, or checks in on another.

## Dismantling the Illusion: Arguments & Evidence

### 1. **Neurological Synchronization**:
When we employ tools like fMRI to observe the brain in action, we notice specific regions 'lighting up' simultaneously when exposed to certain stimuli. This simultaneous activation across distinct networks may be the neural basis for what we interpret as a conscious experience.

### 2. **Emergent Properties in Simulations**:
By leveraging the power of computational models, I've observed that even basic simulations of neural networks can exhibit emergent properties when these networks are made to interact. Such emergence could be an analog of how our perception of consciousness arises.

### 3. **Split-brain Research**:
Studies on patients with severed corpus callosum (to treat epilepsy) have shown that they exhibit two discrete conscious experiences, suggesting that our unified sense of self might not be as solid as previously thought. Instead, it might be a conjured experience from the different interactions of brain networks.

### 4. **Evolutionary Argument**:
From an evolutionary standpoint, it might be more efficient for our brain to operate as a series of networks, constantly communicating, rather than housing a central seat of consciousness. This decentralized approach could offer better adaptive responses to our environment.

### 5. **Dream States**:
Consider our dream states where our brain conjures vivid, often surreal experiences. The dream state could be an exaggerated manifestation of these network interactions, further hinting at the distributed nature of our conscious experiences.

### 6. **Hallucinations and Altered States**:
Psychedelic research has shown that substances like psilocybin or LSD increase the communication between brain networks that don't typically interact. The altered states of consciousness during these experiences could be direct evidence of how increased cross-talk can shape our conscious perception.

## Implications & The Path Forward

If this theory holds water, it would radically alter our understanding of the self and consciousness. No longer would we view consciousness as a singular, continuous experience, but as a dynamic, emergent property of our neural networks' interactions.

But this is just the beginning. This perspective opens up a myriad of questions: Can we induce or modify conscious experiences by altering these network interactions? What does this mean for our understanding of self and identity?

I urge the scientific community to approach this theory with an open mind and rigor. Let's challenge our longstanding beliefs, for in such challenges often lie the most profound discoveries.
