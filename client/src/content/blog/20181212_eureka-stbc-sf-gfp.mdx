I have been working on this for a little over a month. Finally managed to build it; stbC sfGFP tagged construction. I was too excited to wait to see if it worked. Thus I picked a sample from the Petri dish directly; this was the result:

Visible by fluorescent microscopy are the individual cells. Note that a zoom should have been done in order to better view the cells. The fluorescence is obvious and present, however there are no foci visible.
