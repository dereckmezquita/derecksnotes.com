Today I learned the following regarding musical notes. There is a simple diagram that can be used in order to keep track of all notes, from normals to sharps and flats. The image is shown below:

What this diagram tells us is that the standard notes are the following: **A, B, C, D, E, F, G**. Moreover there are sharp and flat versions between every single note except **B - C** and **E - F**.

These sharps and flats are referred to as **half-steps**. On a guitar neck every increment in fret that is taken is increasing by one **half-step**. Thus if starting on the **E** string, open is **E**, fret 1 is **F**, then **F#** and so on, until the wheel is complete and we are back at **E** (12 steps down). This is what is referred to as the next octave.
