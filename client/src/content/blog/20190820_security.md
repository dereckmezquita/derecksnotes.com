1. Make different accounts for every different database action, with priviliges limited to what is needed.
1. Encrypt connections to database, eg. SSL.
1. Careful when using prepared statements, eg. PDO, MySQLi.
1. Close SQL connection when done!
1. Password hashing/salting, duh.
1. XSS prevention filters. (HTML Purifier as of 10/13/2017).
1. "expose_php = Off" and "display_errors = Off" (To prevent probing) in php.ini, "ServerTokens Prod" "ServerSignature Off" and "DefaultType application/x-httpd-php" in httpd.conf.
1. NEVER use direct user input as file/folder names.
1. PHP/Apache permissions on the system.
1. Use UTF-8 charset.
1. No user input on shell_exec, exec, passthru, system.
