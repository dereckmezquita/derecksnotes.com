Fucking bullshit CSS, always forgetting how to centre shit. It is in no way logical, and even harder to actually remember.

So you want to centre some shit with CSS? Okay well it involves `margin: auto;` somewhere that's sure. But how again? Okay dickhead well just do this:

```css
html, body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

body {
    background: #333;
}

.centre {
    top: 100px;
    display: block;
    position: relative;
    margin: 0 auto;
    width: fit-content;
}
```
