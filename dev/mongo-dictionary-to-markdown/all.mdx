This is often assisted by a change in temperature: two [complementary sequences](#complementary) are often heated up (to say 95°C) and then allowed to cool down. The heating removes self-annealing, which causes [secondary structures](#secondary_structure) to form in the [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid), which might [inhibit](#inhibitor) annealing to the other [molecule](#molecule). The cooling down allows the formation of [hydrogen bonds](#hydrogenBond) between the two [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) strands. The opposite process to annealing is melting or [denaturing](#denature) of [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid), which happens at high temperatures.

<a id="codon">Codon</a> - A triplet (three) of [ribonucleotides](#ribonucleotides) in [mRNA](#mrna) that encodes for an [amino acid](#amino_acid).

 Note that whether or not a codon matches this table depends on the organism. Some organisms, especially [microorganisms](#microOrganism) and [bacteria](#bacteria) often present modified readings of these codons (known as alternative codons). This is dependant on the presence or not of a [tRNA](#trna) capable of matching the [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) sequence (codon).

These primers should contain common regions and "degenerated regions". These degenerated regions are denoted as N; N meaning any of the 4 nucleotides may occupy that spot. Note that if a sequence is ordered with 40N then that would mean that there are 440 \= 1.2 · 1024 different sequences possible. Note the tube received will contain a mixture of all the different possible sequences and not just specific ones.

<a id="derived">Derived</a> - Describes a character state that is present in one or more subclades, but not all, of a clade under consideration. A derived character state is inferred to be a modified version of the primitive condition of that character, and to have arisen later in the evolution of the clade. For example, "presence of hair" is a primitive character state for all mammals, whereas the "hairlessness" of whales is a derived state for one subclade within the Mammalia.

<a id="double_inverse_lineweaver_burk_plot_double_reciprocal_plot">Double inverse/Lineweaver-Burk plot/double reciprocal plot</a> - A graphical reprsentation of the Lineweaver-Burk equation used in enzyme cinetics. The plot allows us to derive useful information as to the nature of a [Michaelis-Menten](#michaelis_menten_kinetics) type reaction. The reciprocal of the formula is the following:

 $$ V = \frac{V_{max}\[S\]}{K_m + \[S\]} $$ $$ \frac{1}{V} = \frac{K_m + \[S\]}{V_{max}\[S\]} = \frac{K_m}{V_{max}} \cdot \frac{1}{\[S\]} + \frac{1}{V_{max}} $$

An example of the double inverse plot. Multiple points must be calculated from the resulting formula. The condition that varies is concetration of the substrate experimentally: 1/\[s\].

 Note that this equation's simplified form comes out to the form Y = Ax + B. This can be described as a linear curve on a graph as shown.

 This method can be used to determine enzyme cinetics: Km, Vmax. The y-intercept of the graph is equivalent to the inverse of Vmax, and the x-intercept represents -1/KVm.

Enzyme inhibition shown using the double inverse. The different motifs formed by the curves allows us to deduce the type of inhibiton.

 These representations also allow us to visualise the different forms of [enzyme inhibition](#inhibition).

Types of inhibition, the concentration of of the inhibitor is the only thing that changes.

- Competitive inhibition: Km increased, Vmax unaffected. The inhibitor matches the active site and fixes itself there.
- Un-competitive inhibition: Km reduced, Vmax reduced. The inhibitor matches a zone close to the active site and thus impedes the substrate from fixing itself there.
- Non-competitive: Km unaffected, Vmax reduced. The inhibtor fixes itself somewhere else on the enzyme and changes the conformation of the active site.

<a id="isotopic_analysis">Isotopic Analysis</a> - The study of the geochemistry of stable isotopes in naturally occurring sediments and biological structures. Stable isotopes are atomic variations of elements that are stable over long periods of time, meaning they do not radioactively decay. Several elements, like oxygen and carbon, have several stable forms. Oxygen, for example, occurs in nature as 16O and 18O — these two forms are isotopes. They have different numbers of neutrons (16O has two more neutrons than 18O), and and is therefore heavier. Because the two isotopes have different masses, chemical and physical reactions like bonding, evaporation, and precipitation occur at different frequencies. The ratio of stable isotopes is preserved in chemical compounds like water, ice, and calcium carbonate and provides information on the environmental conditions at the time the compound formed. For example, the ratio of 18O/16O in an ice sample is linked to the water temperature of ancient oceans, which in turn reflects ancient climates.

For calculating these temperatures, which are to be used when designating a [PCR](#polymerase_chain_reaction_pcr) protocol, the following formulas are to be used:

 For primers with a length inferiour to 14 nt the following is used:

 $$ Tm = (n(A) + n(T)) \cdot 2 + (n(G) + n(C)) \cdot 4 $$

 For primers with a length superiour to 13 nt the following is used:

 $$ Tm = 64.9 + 41 \cdot \frac{(n(G) + n(C) - 16.4)}{(n(A) + n(T) + n(G) + n(C))} $$

 Both these formulas assume the following: 50 nM primer, 50 mM Na+, and pH 7.0\. n(x) designates the number of whichever base.

<a id="michaelis_menten_kinetics">Michaelis-Menten Kinetics</a> - A chemical kinetic scheme for describing the rate of an [enzyme](#enzyme)\-[catalysed](#catalysation) processes. It relates the rate of reaction rate V at which the product \[P\] is formed, to the depletion of the substrate \[S\] from which it is produced. These are linked by Km the Michaelis constant, which corresponds to the substrate \[S\] concentration at which the speed v is half the vmax.

 There are a few terms to take into consideration before attacking the formula#miRna: vmax is the maximal speed at which the reaction will take place, (vmax/2) is half maximal speed, which brings us to km or the substrate concentration at which the rate of reaction will half speed.

A curve demonstrating a generique enzyme substrate reaction. The graph shows, a reaction rate/speed (concentration/s), in relation to a substrate concentration.

 $$ \nu = \frac{d\[P\]}{dt} = \frac{V_{max} \[S\]}{K_m + \[S\]} $$

 km can be isolated in the following way:

 $$ km = \frac{V_{max}\[S\] - \nu\[S\]}{\nu} $$

 Its simplest formulation considers three processes:

1. The binding of substrate to enzyme
2. The unbinding of the substrate-enzyme complex
3. The conversion of the enzyme-substrate complex to the product and the enzyme

 Using [mass-action kinetics](#mass_action_kinetics) and the assumption that [enzyme](#enzyme) [concentrations](#concentration) are much smaller than substrate [concentrations](#concentration), we get an equation for the rate of product (P) production (initial velocity); where Vmax is the maximal velocity (saturating substrate conditions) and Km is the Michaelis constant (the substrate [concentration](#concentration) at half-maximal velocity). More complex [Michaelis-Menten](#michaelis_menten_kinetics) formulations must be used if the release of the product from the enzyme-product complex is slow, ordered-binding is required, or [inhibitors](#inhibitor) are present.

It is often the case that a system has processes which have timescales (how long it takes for the system to reach [equilibrium](#equilibrium)) differing by one or more orders of magnitude. For example, the timescale of [transcription factors](#transcription_factor_tf) binding to [DNA](#dna_desoxyribonucleic_acid) is short, as the binding [equilibrium](#equilibrium) is reached within milliseconds or less. However, the process of producing a mature [protein](#protein) can take minutes or more. Hence, when analysing a system where both processes occur, the binding can be considered to be at [equilibrium](#equilibrium) when discussing how [protein](#protein) dynamics look.

<a id="timing_diagram">Timing Diagram</a> - A diagram showing how a system behaves and [evolves](#evolution) over time. For digital systems, a timing diagram shows the state of the system (and possibly signals within the system) at each tick of a clock. Often a timing diagram is depicted as a table, where each row shows a signal and each column shows an instance of time. The value in the table is the value of the particular signal at the particular time. Another way to depict the timing diagram is to draw a value trace over time for each signal and stack them such that time flows left to right.

 Notice that these two definitions are complementary, in that if: an acid gives off a proton, it is releasing a charged particle H+ into the environment; yet at the same time it must accept those electrons 2e\- from the proton in order to release it.

 An acid is written as AH and its conjugated base as A\-. The couple is written as: AH/A\-.

 Notice that the acid is giving up its H to the base, and in exchange the A receives the negative charge \- which in fact represents the two electrons given up by the Hydrogen.

 If one were to follow the electrons they go from: H to A, and from the B to the H in order to form the bond.

<a id="aromaticity_aryl">Aromaticity (aryl)</a> - This is the property of being cyclic (a closed ring), and planar with a ring of resonance bonds. Aromatic chemical groups are called aryl. Requirements for aromaticity, known as Huckel's rule, are as follows:
1. The molecule must be cyclic; can be composed of one or more rings.
2. The molecule must be planar, allows for p-orbitals to be parallel and interact.
3. That the molecule must be formed of a continous ring of conjugated π bonds (p-orbital interaction); if a heteronome participates in conjugation then its doublet must be able to be conjugated with the other π bonds.
4. The molecule must have 4n + 2 electrons in a conjugated system (n ∈ ℕ); normally on sp2\-hybridised atoms, and sometimes sp-hybridised.

 To apply the rule, count the number of π eletrons in the molecule, then set the equation equal to this number. Solve for n. If n ∈ ℕ, and the other rules are true then the molecule is indeed aromatic.

 Example: benzene, 3 double bonds, 6 π electrons. $$ 4n + 2 = 6 $$ $$ 4n = 4 $$ $$ n = 1 $$ $$ n \in \mathbb{N} $$ In order to know which are the π electrons to be counted, you must look at those which reside in the p-orbitals; the hybrid atoms have one p-orbital each. Thus if each part of the cyclic compound is hybridised sp2 then this means that the molecule is completely conjugated (each atom has one p-orbital) and the electrons in these p orbitals are in fact π electrons.

 Aromatic molcules are very stable and do not react easily with other compounds. Most common aromatic compounds are derivatives of benzene (found in petroleum).

 Aromaticity does not necessarily indicate an odour. This misnomer comes from the association initially given by August Wilhelm Hofmann in 1855 who studied a class of benzene molecules; which did indeed emit odours.

Benzene resonance structures.

 Chemically aromaticity refers to a conjugated system made of alternating single and double bonds in a ring. This arrangement allows for electrons in the molecule's π system to be delocalised; increasing the molecules stability. Such molecules are represented by a resonance hybrid of different strucutres.

 Bond lengths in such a strucutre are the intermediate of the two composing representations. X-ray diffraction has shown that all six carbon-carbon bonds in benzene are of the same length: 1.4 Å. C-C double bonds are typically at 1.35 Å, and single bonds at 1.47 Å.

The π orbitals allow for the double bond stick out of the ring, this allows for the double bond formation; consequently these orbitals can then share any electrons involved.

 The ring contains π bonds which are formed from the overlap of atomic p-orbitals; which can interact with each other freely as they are outside the plane of the molecule. Each electron is shared by all six atoms in the ring; there are not enough electrons to form double bonds between all carbon atoms, but the "extra" electrons strengthen the exisiting bonds and give rise to the resonance structure.

<a id="dissociation_constant_water">Dissociation Constant (water)</a> - The rate at which water dissociates from its protons. This can be derived from [autoprotolysis](#autoprotolysis).

 Dissociation constant: $$ K_w = 1.0 \cdot 10^{-14} $$ 

 $$ K_w = \frac{\[H_{3}0^{+}\]\[HO^-\]}{\[ H_{2}0\]^2} $$

 Since this is theoretically measured in a pure solution of water and the concentration of pure substances is not taken into account then the formula simplifies to:

 $$ K_w = \[H_{3}0^{+}\]\[HO^-\] $$

 Moreover, since according to the balanced equation for [autoprotolysis](#autoprotolysis) \[H3O+\] = \[HO\-\], and thus we can simplify the formula even more:

 $$ K_w = X^2 $$

 Thus:

 $$ \[H_{3}0^{+}\] = \[HO^-\] = \sqrt{1.0 \cdot 10^{-14}} = 1.0 \cdot 10^{-7} mol/L $$

 And thus we've demonstrated that water's $$ pH = -log(1.0 \cdot 10^{-7}) = 7 $$.

<a id="oxonium_ion">Oxonium Ion</a> - An oxonium ion is any oxygen cation with three bonds, the simplest form is H3O+ but in reality can be R3O+; R meaning any other groups. An oxonium ion is not a [hydronium ion](#Hydronium_Ion), this term refers specifically to ions which have hydrogens.

<a id="ph_potential_hydrogen">pH (Potential Hydrogen)</a> - Loosely speaking a measure of the concentration of free protons in an aqueous solution. A more precise definition is the activity of protons in the solution or a measure of \[H3O+\]. This allows us to determine the [acidity](#acid) or [basicity](#base) of a solution. These measurements are all put in the context of water, and relative to water; thus water's pH is equal to 7; acids are less than 7, bases are greater than 7.

 In a base: $$ \[HO^-\] > H_3 O^+ $$ In an acid: $$ \[HO^-\] < H_3 O^+ $$
- Hydroxide ions = \[OH\-\]
- Hydronium ions = \[H3O+\]

 pH is measured on a logarithmic scale, it is measured in units of moles per liter of hydrogen ions often called [hydronium ions](#hydronium_ion) sometimes less precisely called [oxonium ions](#oxonium_ion).

 Precisely speaking this measurement of hydrogen ions in a solution can be done experimentally. In fact an experimental measure is designated as p\[H\]. Moreover, the difference between pH and p\[H\] is so small that they are sometimes used interchangeably. The way to find this would be by use of the Nernst equation as shown below:

 $$ E = E^{0} + f\frac{2.303RT}{F}\log\left\[ H^{+} \right\] $$

 The strict definition of pH does not have associated units, and is dimensionless. It is described as the log of the inverse of hydrogen activity in a solution:

 $$ pH = -log(a_{H^+}) = log\left(\frac{1}{a_{H^+}}\right) $$

 But most often used in the following form with \[H3O+\] being the concentration of hydronium ions in mol/L:

 $$ pH = -log\[H_3 O^+\] $$ $$ \[H_3 O^+\] = 10^{-pH} $$

<a id="poh_potential_hydroxide">pOH (Potential Hydroxide)</a> - The inverse of pH, this measures the potential hydroxide activity of a solution: HO\-.

 $$ pOH = -log\[OH^-\] $$ $$ \[OH^-\] = 10^{-pOH} $$

 Note that the sum of pOH along with [pH](#ph_potential_hydrogen) is equal to the total of the scale.

 $$ pH + pOH = 14 $$

<a id="π_bond_pi_bond">π bond (Pi bond)</a> - These are covalent chemical bonds where two lobes of an orbital on one atom overlap with two other lobes of another laterally. The Greek letter π is used to refer to the p-orbitals. The symmettry of the π bond is the same as that of the p-orbital; π bonds occur with p-orbitals and or d-orbitals.

 π bonds are weaker than σ bonds, requiring 612 kj of energy to break vs 348 kj respectively, that is 264 kj required to break a π bond; as the σ bond is comprised in the 612 kj initially quoted \*(C-C bonds).

 Single covalent bonds result in σ bonds, multiple bonds yeild π bonds. These also result in unsaturated molecules, as electrons are used for multiple bond formation rather than fixing H. Note that π bonds do not allow free rotation around the central axis as σ bonds do.
