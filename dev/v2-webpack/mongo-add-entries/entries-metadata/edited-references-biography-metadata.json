Leeuwenhoek was educated at Warmond school for a period of time and then sent to his uncle in Benthuizen. At 16 Leeuwenhoek would become apprentice to a bookkeeper in Amsterdam with whom he would stay for six years. Leeuwenhoek would later become a tradesman and later a scientist. Leeuwenhoek was native to the same city as another famous citizen of Delft, Johannes Vermeer. There are some suggestions that the man in two of Vermeer's paintings might be Leeuwenhoek: The Astronomer and The Geographer. After the death of Vermeer in 1675 Leeuwenhoek would act as executor of his will.",

Latin was one of the first languages that Linnaeus learned. This was important as it would give him access to the academic world later on, in which Latin was the dominant language. Linnaeus was home schooled in his early life by his father and a tutor, until the age of 10 at which point he began attending school. His main interest would however remain his botanical studies which he had begun as a child in the family's garden.",
