        "summary": "Biology is a complex science which can deal with molecules that range in size from a single atom. A proton for example is an important biological player consisting of only one. Polymers of DNA can be over billions of atoms in size. The first chromosome in humans for example is over 247 million base pairs long, and can contain over 15 billion atoms. So representations of these molecules can become a little problematic. This problem is especially present in the representation of proteins and other large molecules. Representation of these molecules will be made on this site mostly as space fill models, with different colours to indicate different amino acid chains. Reason being that space fill is one of the most realistic protein representations which exists, not giving us too much information while still enough to understand basic structure and its relation to function. When necessary or interesting to do so, a schematic model using α helixes and β sheets will be shown for illustrative purposes.",
